::::::: 1992 ::::::::
Maintenance taken over by David Grabiner
--------- 7/16
moria4.c: bash(), use random direction if player is confused
spells.c: fire_ball(), fire_bolt(), don't update recall if monster not lit;
	this can happen if bolt hits an invisible monster
spells.c: speed_monsters(), sleep_monsters2(), dispel_creature(), 
	turn_undead(), only affect creatures within MAX_SIGHT 
spells.c: mass_poly(), area of effect should be <= MAX_SIGHT, was <
spells.c: destroy_area(), remove light from player's spot
spells.c: enchant(), add new variable limit, chance of failure is now
	(plusses/limit), with very slight chance of success over limit
scrolls.c: when enchanting melee weapons to damage, set limit to weapon's
	maximum damage, otherwise use 10 to give behavior similar to old method
misc2.c: magic_treasure(), make standard deviation of damage bonus on a melee 
	weapon proportional to weapon's maximum damage; these changes mean
	that daggers can no longer become powerful weapons
treasure.c: the Zweihander has now become a great weapon, value increased from
	1000 to 1500
externs.h: fix declaration for enchant()
staffs.c, wands.c: give everyone a slight chance to use difficult wands and
	staffs, otherwise a warrior will never be able to use many items
--------- 7/23
death.c: print_tomb(), insert msg_print(CNIL) so that "You are using:" and
	"You are carrying:" don't get combined as one message; this made it
	impossible to see the equipment list
store2.c: haggle_insults(), insert msg_print(CNIL) so that insult is always
	recognizable
store2.c: purchase_haggle() and sell_haggle(), new variable didnt_haggle,
	don't call updatebargain if no haggle
store1.c: noneedtobargain(), changed to sliding scale, (good-3*bad) must
	be more than 5 + (price/50) to skip haggling, so that haggling for
	cheap items is over quickly, but can still eventually skip
	haggle for all items
store1.c: updatebargain(), now update for all items worth >9 gold, instead
	of just 10-999, since it is now possible to skip haggling for more
	valuable items as well
--------- 7/25
moria4.c: bash(), unsuccessful bash takes a turn; otherwise, you can
	attempt to bash in different directions while confused or to locate
	invisible monsters; eliminate variable no_bash
--------- 7/27
check all above changes
moria4.c: bash(), get "You bash at empty space" method when bashing a
	wall, corrected to "nothing interesting	happens"; this also
	prevents bashing from locating a secret door
--------- 8/9
merge in all changes from 5.4.0 to 5.4.1
creature.c: update attack information only if monster is visible; update
	death information even if monster is not visible, since
	information will be on tombstone
*: change version number to 5.5.0
--------- 8/12
spells.c: enchant(), guard against randint(0) if called with limit of 0
	(it shouldn't be).
moria4.c: throw_object(), py_bash(), don't do negative damage
shortnam.sed, spells.c: fire_ball(), fix spelling of "envelops"
doc/faq: remove old spoilers file, and put current FAQ here instead
*: put my name (DJG) in credits as contact
*: change copyright date in all source files to 1992
---------- 8/13
release umoria 5.5.0
