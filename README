UNIX Moria 4.85
(Differences from 4.85 to 4.84 are mostly minor bug fixes, and better
 portability.)

Moria is a dungeon adventure game in the manner of rogue, but
not descended from rogue.  Moria is to VMS systems, as rogue
is to UNIX.

-------------------------------------------------------------

This is my first official release.  Work is still in progress.
This project started in February '87, and play testing started in early April.
Bug reports from my playtesters have become relatively infrequent,
so the game should be relatively stable now.

Please send bug reports and/or fixes to wilson@ernie.Berkeley.EDU
Save file formats may change again.

This version of Moria is based on the original 4.8 VMS Pascal sources
written by Robert Koeneke, Jimmey Todd, Gary McAdoo and others at
the University of Oklahoma.  I have converted the program into C
for BSD Unix.  The program has since been slowly diverging from the
original game as I have 'fixed' things that didn't seem to be right.
Major changes of note are incompatible save file formats (who cares?)
and an optional rogue-like user interface for my UNIX version as opposed
to a numeric keypad interface for the VMS version.

To avoid confusion, you may want to refer to this as UNIX Moria,
or perhaps wilson moria.

Mike Callahan at the University of Oklahoma (seismo!okstate!uokmax!mikec)
also is working on a Unix version of Moria and is planning on posting
it to the net when it is finished.  This will probably be more official
than my version, but I have not heard from him in a while.

Don Kneller has ported the program to the IBM PC, and is calling it PCMORIA.

My thanks to Dave Chin and Dave desJardins of Berkeley for playtesting the
early versions and making many suggestions.  Thanks also to Craig Norborg
of Purdue for rewritting the setuid/scoreboard code in a more rational
manner.

There exists another port of Moria to UNIX that was done by wex@MCC.COM.
Hopefully, our two versions can be merged, but don't expect to see the result
for a while.

The program has three options.  The -r option changes the game to
use a rogue like user interface.  The -o option forces the game to use
the original user interface.  The -s option prints the scoreboard
and exits.

There is no man page yet, and the original VMS Moria docs should be rewritten
to take into account some of the changes.
