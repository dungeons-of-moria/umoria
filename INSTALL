To compile the program, edit the config.h file to change the
names of the files the game uses and the wizard info.  For USG systems,
copy Makefile.USG to Makefile.  For Ultrix (and 4.2BSD), copy Makefile.ultrix
to Makefile.  For 4.3BSD and SUNS copy Makefile.43 to Makefile.  Type make
to compile the game.  You may want to edit the 'Moria_hours' file
to indicate during what hours people are allowed to play the game.
The game needs to be installed setuid for the scoreboard to work.
Use the command 'chmod 4511 moria' to do this.
(Or just type 'make install' after setting BINDIR and LIBDIR in the
Makefile to appropriate values.)

There are two choices for the key bindings, the original style and
a rogue-like style.  You can choose which one is to be the default
by changing the value of CFLAGS
  -DKEY_BINDINGS=ORIGINAL for the original style
  -DKEY_BINDINGS=ROGUE_LIKE for the rogue-like style


If the display does not look right, try adding -DBUGGY_CURSES to CFLAGS
(as in the ultrix Makefile).  Delete io.o and moria.o, and then recompile.

For the IBM PC-RT, 3B2, 3B20, and perhaps others, you must
add -DNO_SIGNED_CHARS to CFLAGS.

You can choose which default key bindings you wish to have by
changing the definition of KEY_BINDINGS in the Makefile.
  For rogue like -DKEY_BINDINGS=ROGUE_LIKE
  For original style -DKEY_BINDINGS=ORIGINAL

The game has been successfully compiled on a VAX running 4.3BSD,
SUN 3/50 running UNIX 4.2 Release 3.2, and a microvax running ULTRIX 2.0.
The program assumes that ints are 32 bits, and that
sizeof(char *) == sizeof(int).  The program passes lint
so further porting should not be too hard.
BSD/UNIX dependencies are(?) limited to the files io.c, save.c, and
signals.c.
