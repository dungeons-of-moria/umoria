make variables.h monsters.h treasure1.h and treasure2.h into c files

added compiler option to Makefile, so that installer can choose
  which key binding style should be the default
control-c puts you in scoreboard only after character generation complete

Things to be fixed:
if amulet raises stat over 118, stat will be lowered (more than it should be)
	when take amulet off
loss of strength doesn't force you to drop items
what if can't write into current directory? (saves files, etc.)
this file should be in reverse chronological order!
it is possible to get 'final offer = 0' when selling an object

Long term stuff, enhancement suggestions:
use environment variables, for example to specify rogue-like keys
and option to restore files from default save filename
commands not close enough to rogue style
scoreboard have all scores, not top twenty
command line option to print out times open
strange streatment of cursed armor
can't drop or identify items in equipment list
let o, c, D commands automatically pick direction when they can
SYS V does not lock scoreboard when changing it
it is too slow?  spends about half of its time doing screen i/o
replace magic numbers with constants
remove trailing blanks from every line
for throw command, ask for direction first (like rogue)
don't change letters of items in inventory (like rogue, again)
be able to move onto objects without picking them up (like rogue)
when moving on objects, say what character moved onto (like rogue)
