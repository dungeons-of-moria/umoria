---------------------- 6/27
treasure1.c: rings of weakness are now initially cursed
spells.c: cdefense & 0x80000000 should be cmove, correct comments
many files, check places where find_flag cleared and make sure move_char(5)
	is called if necessary, particularly msg_print caused a problem
--------------------- 6/28
Makefile: updated dependency list for .c files
many files: change move_char(5) to move_light(char_row, char_col, char_row,
	char_col), avoid problems with potential recursive calls to move_char()

Working on:

Cheating/Tricks:
should potion stat increase (in_statp) be based on cstr (including ring plus)
	or on the characters base str (without ring plus)
  presently cstr which allows cheating by manipulation of cstr
  should de_statp be changed also?
should de_statt followed by in_statt increase stat to next 18/xx mod 10?
grape jelly trick, restore levels take you back to old hit point levels
  or give new levels based on current stats?
can circle monsters, by only using diagonals in a diamond shape

Things to be fixed:

check plurals "~" in object names, esp. Pint in treasure2.c
make get_panel run stops user customizable?
objects in outside corners do not stop run
moria1.c: area_affect does not need to check "if (find_flag)"
carefully check everyplace that clears find_flag, there are a lot
	of unnecessary checks, perhaps even some recursive calls to move_char
check setting of moria_flag in dungeon.c, esp. after restore_char ()
add "moria ^file" option to automatically do wizard restore,
   do the umask calls in the program instead of forcing user to type them
don't ask for quit on char '\0', should instead ignore it
check for EOF when reading characters
complaint that a hangup (kill -1) results in a game whose
	score will no longer be posted to the scoreboard
resting should have small but finite chance of waking a monster
  perhaps check once every 10 turns against randint(6) > stealth
cursor should be positioned somewhere before each inkey call
all npc spells should print descriptive message
allow rerolling after choose race/class
remove "clear" from random potion names?
pad should take a char not a string
print a number with the repeat_msg command
Message line overextending into second line should be erased
identify staffs/wands as having zero charges, when they run out
``can't carry that much weight'' before ``that many items'' is wrong?
   I like it the way it is now, though
still too slow on i/o, perhaps rewrite to avoid refresh() calls?
	perhaps use only motion optimization stuff?
Dot tunneling command
encrypt info before writing it to the save file
   perhaps xor with stat buffer
dprint in death.c is stupid!!
prt_map in misc1.c is stupid!!
draw_block and sub2_move_light is pretty stupid also, in moria1.c!!
problems reported with many calls to detect_sdoors, I think this is a result
	of the vault_trap bug fixed 4/6
subval, missile_ctr could be short ints
note that some armor can decrease to-hit values in docs,
	should these be displayed in name?
missing amulets, 1-4 strength, constitution, intelligence, dexterity
missing rings 5-6 gain wisdom, gain charisma
	note that missing rings/amulets are disjoint
missing staff 9 genocide
missing staff 24 mass_genocide
high level offensive spells give have a far lower damage/mana ratio than
	magic missiles
how to abort run on systems without ^C?
	perhaps some ifdefed code which does no-blocking I/O for them?
add death due to starvation
wielding heavy wepaons, fix + to hit on screen?
don't let dragons breathe on first attack, AMHD is nasty
	especially after the screen changes to the next panel
checking both ((!m_ptr->ml) or (!see_invis && mon invis)) is probably
	redundant when determining whether or not player can see a monster
list of spell books not cleared when get cast which spell? prompt
should we call m_name if spell only applies to visible creatures?
many spells do not print desciptive comment, aggravate_monster for instance
stores: haggling gets very boring
  add prompt to fix price of all objects with same starting price
  always go to minimum price after player has exhibited his excellence at
       haggling
when moving on objects, say what character moved onto (like rogue)
be able to move onto objects without picking them up (like rogue)
for throw command, ask for direction first (like rogue)
SYS V does not lock scoreboard when changing it
compressing save files would make many people happy
it is pretty easy to defeat the file protection mechanism, should I toughen
	it up?
if amulet raises stat over 118, stat will be lowered (more than it should be)
	when take amulet off, fix this by having 4 values for each stat
this file should be in reverse chronological order!
clonning shimmering molds, one droppped a chest, went over to search chest,
	panic save, get panic save everytime restore character, this
	may be related to old trap generation problem fixed 4/6
weight problem reported, character can not pick anything up?
what if can't write into current directory? (saves files, etc.)
should detect monster work on invisible creatures if have see invisible
	ability from ring/sword/etc.?
does not understand ~ in path names
loss of strength doesn't force you to drop items
in general, loss of an ability should have many affects, non of which are
	implemented, for example, lose of intelligence should cause a mage
	to lose spells
cases of permanent slowness reported?
add user name to scoreboard?
also add points and experience to scoreboard
change cost in sell_haggle to a long
change item_value to return a long
change turn to a long
store_open should be a long
use of reset_flag for free moves still a little inconsistent
fix save files to include obj desc, then only need one random number
	generator which can use table program
replace magic numbers with constants
name objects if use did not identify them

add a pull-back map command like the PC version, display entire map on screen
   only showing important features, like stairs

Very Hard things to add:
recenter character on screen?
can't look in any direction, only in the 8 dirs
can't cast in any direction,

Long term stuff, enhancement suggestions:
give player something to do with money, i.e. 1Million gp for a HA +10 +10 sword
'flavor' the levels, dragons on one level, undead on another, etc.
what's been discovered list
use environment variables to specify rogue-like/original keys
use environment variable for default save file
add option to restore files from default save filename
commands not close enough to rogue style
fixed item lettering in inventory, in-line/cmd-line options?
scoreboard have all scores, not top twenty
command line option to print out times open
can't drop, identify, pick up, or throw  items in equipment list
Y destroy command, allow destroy from equipment list
let o, c, D commands automatically pick direction when they can
give rogue's a chance to steal, e.g. let monsters carry items that they
  pick up
give magic users a chance at pre identifying scrolls
could use a help system, like VMS version
make scroll of identify more common, to help non-MU character classes

Features:
hero/superhero do not subtract hit points when effect wears off
WOR scroll can save you with minus hit points!!
detect monster does not detect invisible monsters (normally)
can hit monsters in walls, but can not cast at them
can not enchant something with negative numbers (i.e. cursed items)
how does armor protect against breath/gas? it doesn't!!!
run stops one character before room lights, because it is supposed to
