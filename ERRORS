stores probably should buy items which have been marked {damned} by being worn
and then cleared via remove curse, after all they buy unident damned items

creating traps can destroy staircases

chests should create treasure appropriate to the level they were found on,
not the level that they are opened on

color MacMoria bugs: the colors dialog box says greed not green
	the help dialog lists the wrong versions
	my address is wrong

when wearing a ring of speed, light should not be used up as fast, the faster
you are moving, the more turns it should last
- by the same reasoning, store lockout are broken too, in fact just about
  anything using time won't work `correctly' when character is sped up

calling put_qio() every turn during running significantly slows it down
on slow hosts which are using curses, I believe it was added only for
aesthetics, and it probably isn't strictly necessary, could at least
surround it with an #ifndef FAST_RUNNING or similar

when thief steals an object, say what was stolen in message
when item in backpack is destroyed, indicate what item was destroyed
inventory does not take a turn

display_scores(), at end of the game, should display top 15 or so scores, and
list the current player's score below that if not in the top 15 list, at least,
the value of show_player should be false at the end
- better, display_scores can put a message line at the bottom like this
	( ESC : return to game	space : toggle all scores/your scores)
and then the player can easily choose which scores to see

the 32767 limit in the recall code for number of monsters killed is too
easy to reach, making it unsigned will extend the range to 65535,
making it a long would increase program size by 2K, I don't think that this
change is worth the extra memory used

Mac: choosing `9 point' from the screen menu results in a 1" square window
which won't expand or grow, switching back to 12 point gives a huge window
with type that appears to be about 100 points or so

monsters should probably not be summoned on top of a rune of protection

could make scorefile code more efficient if I read/write more than one entry
at a time

for MSDOS: shouldn't the treasure.c file change '#' to wallsym, and '.'
  to floorsym?, shouldn't the save.c file change '.' to floorsym and vice
  versa, just like it already does for wallsym?

VMS curses apparently has a bug, during resting, the program continually
moves the cursor to the @ sign, which is a no-op and should result in no
output, but the VMS curses code outputs control commands to the terminal,
this makes resting run slow on bandwidth limited terminals

VMS has 32 bit user ids (UIC), should increase the size of uid's in the
scorefile to 32 bits, and then make the vms uic = getgid()<<16+getuid()
which is 32 bits

remove the hours support for all micros, or else give people the option
in the config.h file to remove it

when functions are not used, ifdef out the calls instead of providing
dummy functions, to save some space

save.c creates two files under VMS, because it first calls 'open' and
then later calls 'fopen', rewrite so that only one file will be created

in store.c, the comment "Your mother was a troll!" doesn't mean anything
if you are a half-troll, change to Ogre?

the ms_misc.c file maps the 'Ins' key, which is the '0' key to 'i',
this confuses the hell out of a lot of people, this IS documented, but
few people read the documentation

add a turns counter to the higscores entry, and check this when restoring
a character, don't score the character if this value is different
this prevents someone from playing a character, goofing, saving it while
alive, and then going back to the first savefile

haste self is a level 1 potion, and super heroism is level 3, both
seem far too low of a level for the potions considering how useful they
are, increasing the levels would make them more common deeper in the dungeon
restore potions are level 40 are too deep, they are available in the stores,
and just aren't that powerful of a potion
DJG: haste self is needed at level 1 for early encounters with nasty monsters
super heroism could be higher

the sorting code does not work with foodstuffs, problem is that when
restore a 5.2.1 character which has unsorted food, the new code may
put a food ration at the start instead of merging it with the other unsorted
food, thus overflowing the inventory size, there are few 5.2.1 characters
left anyways, so perhaps this isn't much of a problem anymore

wine/ale should be potions to be quaffed, not foodstuffs to be eaten

^M = ^J when digging, can't really solve well, because of bugs in some
version of curses which requires this to be true

perhaps add an option to control the Drop One/Drop All query for multiple
stacking items

the choice of whether or not duplicate characters should be scored should
really be an option in the config.h file, since there exist single-user
unix machines, and multi-user IBM-PCs (on a network)
- also, the decision of whether to limit each player to one entry per
character type should be an option (perhaps the same one)

give warriors a better chance of detecting that ego weapons are magik,
but only for ego weapons, not all items

an inscription is lost when two objects are merged, either choose longest,
or ask player, try to combine them, at least do something

Macintosh
- mac version does not clear screen after saving a character
  restart variables are not reset as they should (maybe fixed?)
- mac moria crashes with the 384 size resource?, works fine with 512k size
- mac moria crashes when trying to write past the end of the screen,
  specifically, if have a weapon with more than 80 characters, and put it last
  in the equipment list, then mac version will crash
  add code to put_buffer to truncate strings?
- the CRuntime.o and CLibraries.o ARE needed for the mac makefiles.
- the file type and creator are not set for the character stats file
- when save a game and hit the cancel button, it still says the
  game is being saved even though it isn't
- when a character dies, the savefile is not marked as dead
- should be able to find config file in same directory as the program
- should get version number from constants, not hardwired into resources
- should have color menu enabled even on B&W monitor, so you can switch
	black and white if desired
- does not work on 512K mac, seems to be enough memory, but it uses routines
	which are not in the old ROMS, 512K macs are obsolete, so this is
	probably not worth fixing

IBMPC
- received report that -w command gives 'file from wrong version' error
- when followed by monster, and reach edge of screen, sometimes the game
  hangs and you must type a character for it to continue, either a Turbo C
  bug or a PC-Moria bug
- tunneling does not work with the numeric keypad when using rogue-like mode,
  i.e. ctrl-4
- on PC, only draw during traceback, perhaps make this an option, this is
  a CGA specific problem (most people have VGA now a days), and only applies
  to the Turbo C builtin screen code, tcio.c, PC-Curses does not have this
  problem, in Turbo Pascal, there is a variable in the CRT unit that one
  can set to enable this feature
- tcio.c file does not handle redraw ^R at all

run under Saber C to see if that turns up any bugs

- when read curse weapon on a HA/DF weapon, the code does not clear the AC
  bonus of the weapon, cursed gauntlets of slaying don't lose +tohit/+todam,
  and other cases should be fixed also
- if you curse a special magic item (HA, RF, etc), it retains its very high
  value, its cost should be reset to the value in object_list[index]
- if you curse a special cursed object (noise, irritation), it will lose its
  special cursed ability (two wrongs make a right?!?), this should not happen,
  instead of clearing ALL flag bits, should only clear the 'good' ones

if wield a torch, and a silver jelly immediately drains it to 1,
the program will be confused for one turn thinking that you still have
light even though you don't

scoring unfair to humans/warriors/etc, since they have a lower max exp than
other race/classes, should adjust exp downward by inflationary factors
when calculating score?
DJG: unnecessary

should reduce stack usage in generate.c

in the store, should have some way to determine how close one is to
getting perfect haggling

replace all of those heavy weapon messages with an automatic inscription,
how should this be maintainted, should it change only when wielded,
or should it change whenever the players strength changes?

throwing a lot of objects into a pile can cause problems?

make the printing of stuff under monsters an option for those who find
it bothersome

make monster movement more intelligent:
- for slow monsters, in movement_rate(), instead of using mod, use
  (randint(2 - speed) == 1) to make monster movement a little more uncertain
  for fast monsters, give a little variance to speed, i.e. 66% of time monster
  moves at speed, 17% of time move at speed+1, 17% of time move at speed-1
- monsters which are about to die should flee if intelligent
- monsters should breathe at player if only separated by a single column
- better spell selection, don't cast teleport_to when standing next to
  player, etc.
- have monsters with multiple attacks spread the attacks over each turn if
  moving slower than player, instead of doing nothing one turn, and then
  attacking multiple times on the next turn
- remember the previous two moves for each intelligent monster, so they can
  tell which direction they are moving

in get_com(), get_dir(), etc, put -escape- on the msg line if escape
key pressed, useful if message doesn't get deleted, but doesn't this
always happen?, apparently not on the Atari ST MWC port

rubble can be generated underneath a monster, which should not happen

why call sigsetmask(0)?
delete signals() and nosignals() as unnecessary?

killing a shell -1 results in the game disappearing without leaving
a save file, what happened?

the save.c code that says "file exists, overwrite?", can this ever be
executed?, if so, does it do the right thing?,  and also, what happens on
EOF? will it go into an infinite loop on EOF?

what exactly does the damned flag mean, should it be on for all except known2
items, or should it be on when an item is known to be cursed?

add ptodam to damage before calling critical_hits
- modify C command to print to dam bonuses modified by weapon, should
  print both the unmodified bonus, and the modified bonus
- should take about 10 slay dragon arrows to kill AMHD, check this after
  ptodam code is changed, may need to increase damages from +3?
- also check other ego weapons for play balance, maybe reduce ego multipliers

when rogues list Beginners Majik spell book, spells are listed 'a'-'e',
when cast from the spell book, spells are listed 'b'-'f', the spell casting
list should also go from 'a'-'e', but this looks hard to fix

allow SPACE to exit from inventory commands

no monster, except Balrog, can resist mass polymorph, should I make it more
like polymorph?
mass polymorph is much higher level than polymorph, and is useful for
dire emergencies, either don't give monsters a saving throw, or make is
something like level/(3*MAX_MONS_LEVEL/2) which will make it possible but not
certain that the staff will work on AMHD's

should mac port have a separate io.c file?

invisible monsters, and 'headless' monsters should not glare when recovering
from a bash

version.inf file should not contain version number/copyright, these should
be printed from the variable values

in misc1.c, the pusht code requires search of entire cave structure,
this needs to be written more efficiently, perhaps put x,y into inven_type for
every object located somewhere in the cave?

eliminate all #if 0 in the code

**************************
Changes that can wait...

only let warriors get *GREAT* hits?
in critical_hits(), change the threshholds to 400-600-800, which will make
all melee weapons eligible for great hits, and only let warriors get great
hits
since this makes Mage's much worse fighters, swap Sleep II for Lightning
Ball (giving a much needed intermediate Ball spell), and Recharge I for
Object Dectection (to compensate for Priest's sense surroundings)
DJG: object detection isn't very useful

increase the classes of weapons from 3 to 5, i.e. missile, blunt, assassin,
melee (two handed weapons, etc., only these can do *GREAT* hits), and normal.
Then modify fighting abilities as follows:
         mis   blu   ass   mel   nor
          a)    b)    c)    d)    e)              -- := suck
Warrior   +     +     +     ++    +               -  := iffy
Rogue     +     0     ++    -     0               0  := unchanged
Mage      0     0     0     --    0               +  := improved
Ranger    ++    0     0     0     0               ++ := hyperb
Priest    0     +     -     --    0
Paladin   0     ++    0     0     0

the monster memory always prints monster attack types and damage types
together, this can lead to strange situations, for example, if a grey
mushroom patch releases spores, but does not confuse the player, nothing
appears in the monster memory because the player does not know they were
confusion spores, but he/she does know that that spores are released

IBMPC COLOR
- the experimental color support for PC-Moria does not work well when
  trying to display a monster which is the same color as the background
- the disenchanter w and b are not the same color
- CHP changes to the same color as ball/breath that lowered it
- all mushrooms are wrong, except the grey mushroom patch
- invisible monsters can easily be found by casting stinking cloud at the walls
  which will color all spaces green, except the one with the invisible monster

show how many spells player can learn via the 'G' command

add max mana to display in addition to current mana

add inscriptions that apply to a class of objects, not just a single instance

shouldn't be able to genocide invalid letters; escape out of genocide

have alternative messages to 'dies in a fit of agony', that gets
a bit repetitive, and boring

a command to allow writing the monster memory to a file

get sources for nethack/omega, look for any really good ideas, also check
to see how the implement Mac compatibility, portability, protection,
and other general concepts

treasure.c has an arrow and a bolt out of order (arrow in the rings, and
bolt in the amulets)

secret doors are always granite, would be nice to have secrets doors
hidden in other types of rock, would make them less obvious when
hightlight seams is on, also current scheme gives an advantage while searching
since walls displayed as % obviously are not secret doors

MAX_SIGHT is 20, but rooms can be larger than twenty across, that gives
strange situation where moving one step away from a monster in a large room
can cause it to disappear, either increase MAX_SIGHT to be size of largest
possible room size, or else use different MAX_SIGHT values in rooms/corridors/
town level?

instead of printing 'it can hit to attack and hit to attack' print
'it can hit to attack twice' in monster descriptions?

- change haggling so that initial price depends on how many good bargains
you have had
- add key to accept price, instead of forcing player to type in price
- when reach perfect haggling, should just give object to player without
asking for any prompt, bad idea if someone mistypes a letter
- add an option so that player can play with or without haggling, without
haggling, give prices that are always, say, 30% above the minimum
- add store commands to buy/sell without haggling, with price say, 20%,
less/greater than asking price

improve map command (see nethack), define an array of special characters,
one for each type of composite wall, say, and then let end users specify
the necessary graphic characters, allow for multiple character graphic
sequences

combat in a room should have a chance of waking up sleeping monsters, except
that it would not be fair, since monsters can send breath weapons through
other monsters, but the player can only attack the nearest monsters

(high level?) monsters should slowly regenerate hit points, esp since the
doc states that the Balrog does
note, if leave level and come back, the Balrog is regenerated (sic) with
full hit points
every 128 turns, let monsters regenerate 1/64 of their total hit points?

have several different types of Balrog, i.e. a fire breathing one,
a cold breathing one, a lightning breathing one, etc.

should be a chance of weapons breaking when try to dig with them?
NO, it is too easy to dig with weapon by accident, shouldn't dull them unless
there is some way to sharpen them which there currently isn't

can get small groups of rooms which are connected to each other, but not
to the rest of the rooms on the level, perhaps check for cycles in
tunnel/room graph before trying to build tunnels?

can not use counted commands while bashing a door, because of the
paralyzation that sometimes occurs always stops a counted command

allow character building, by allocation of a limited number of stat points,
instead of random rerolling??

add another aux inventory slot, so that there is one for picks, and one for
bows

decrease mithril values, increase gem values, more expensive items in the
shops, should be greater difference between prices of low level objects
and high level objects, more gold/silver/copper on lower levels, selling
high enchanted objects should not be so profitable
(good idea here, favorite suggestion for fixing the money problem)

in object_offset(), give 70/71 and 75/76 different codes, shift by 5 (32)
everywhere instead of 6 (64), reduce size of object_ident[] from
7*64 to 9*32, objects 71 must all have 2 added to subval so that they
start at 96, objects 76 must all have 1 added to subval

all variables (including bss) should be initialized before they are used,
see the mac sources

add a macro capability

most case statements should use table or if/else instead, table are much
faster, both give much smaller code

if have one unidentified object, and sell it to a store, and it gets
identified, and you happen to have some similar store items, you will get
a 'combining' message, even though no combining is really taking place,
perhaps adding an extra parameter to identify which indicates whether
the item will remain in inventory after ident, if it does not remain,
then should not give combining message if there is only one of them

many of the constants in constant.h should really be enums instead, this
would make the game more maintainable

some fields of treasure_type are const and could be deleted

missile weapons should be made more useful, make them stackable after
identified if they are identical, increase the benefit of using proper
bow/arrow combo, increase +todam, +tohit more than now, perhaps give
an advantage here to fighters/paladins/rangers/rogues somehow, don't
decrease ptohit so much in inven_throw() (currently reduced by distance)

should recall info be set in breath() for other monsters?

finish monster compiler, write defs for all monsters

should be able to increase digging plusses for weapons??

should be able to increase ring plusses?? this would seriously unbalance
the game if allowed

in the store bargain code, separate the sell good bargains from the purchase
good bargains?  this is important for owners with very high inflate values
as it is easy to reach sell final value, but very difficult to reach purchase
final value, change from 20 to 10 if do this

change move to take a char-number i.e. '0' instead of a number, i.e. 0

put all prt_ functions into a separate file, put all movement functions
in a separate file

define constants for all possible tchars, number-directions, attack-types,
last_line = 23, scroll flags, potion flags, etc

would be nice if 10-23 were all wielded objects, i.e. move light 15 outside
this range

use scroll bars on the Mac version for showing the rest of the level,
L/W, might be confusing since this won't scroll the whole window, only
the dungeon view
have multiple windows, one for inventory, one resizable/scrollable for
dungeon view, etc...

should eliminate need for 70/71 scrolls and 75/76 potions

replace hex flag fields in treasure with constants

should not get message "something rolls under feet" when step on a loose rock
/* Hid Obj*/ trap?, also should not get this message when cast create food
some people prefer to have these messages though

%%%%%%%%%%%%%
ideas from Bron Campbell Nelson bron%bronze.wpd.sgi.com@sgi.sgi.com

potion of boldness should have duration, i.e. should be safe from fear for
a little while after quaffing boldness potion (also heroism/super-heroism)
the current length values seem a little long, perhaps just improve the
characters resistance to fear?

warriors too hard, give them more hitpoints?, lower base-to-hit of other
classes?, fix warrior so can withstand one AMHD poison breath attack?

boots of speed are too hard to find, 1/7000 is ring of speed, 1/14000+ is
boots of speed, other evidence suggests that boots are about 10 times as
rare as rings

items needed for win: see invisible, free action, resist fire, speed, if
add black market, don't make it too easy to get these items

black market suggestions:
staff of teleportation 20000, staff of speed 100000, mushroom of restoring
20000, and perhaps some powerful archery items

heavy armor is useless, does not protect against spells/breate, and reduces
from to-hit, reduce penalty for characters with high STR?

new shop: enchantorium, where enchantments can be purchased for a high
price, price proportional to how many enchants already there (i.e. enchanting
a +9 item costs a fabulous amount, but enchanting a +0 item costs a little
more than one enchant armor/weapon scroll), allow enchant to any value, i.e.
AC/digging for HA/DF, digging for picks/shovels/etc, etc...

less reasonble suggestions follow...

too many weapon types, the variety is useless

have armor protect by subtracting ac/10 (sic) instead of reducing by %

speed is too important, need smaller time quanta

race/class adjustments should be more meaningful, give races/classes max
stat values which are not 18/100

add an autosave option

add more up stairways? currently there are only randint(2) per level,
perhaps guarantee that there will be at least 2

warriors should automatically recognize ego weapons

dispel evil/undead are nearly worthless since they do not do much damage for
their mana cost, change dispel_creature from mon_take_hit (i, randint(damage))
to mon_take_hit (i, damage)

rune of protection is too powerful, reduce OBJ_RUNE_PROT to 800, maybe 1000,
if make this change, should make the spell somewhat easier to cast, say
50% for a level 33 priest
DJG: this makes them much less useful against the Balrog

Balrog should not cast cause serious wounds as it does less damage than a
normal attack, should not cast slow/paralyze since the player almost
certainly will have some form of free action

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

reincarnate, and lose 1/2 exp?

give enchant scrolls (or perhaps just *enchant*) a small probability
of creating ego weapons
give enchant scrolls a small probability of destroying ego enchantments
if they fail to increase pluses

make the number of hits per round probabilistic, i.e. instead of getting
1/2/3/4 hits per round, gives weapons 2.4 hits per round etc, to smoothen
the curve

perhaps add option to order monsters differently?
give list of all monsters of that type, and then recall all if type 0,
else only recall the one indicated by the number typed in
change ident_char() in help.c

have all top level action functions (aim, move, throw, inven_command, etc.)
return true if took a turn, otherwise false

add command to show number of turns played, time spent playing, date character
started, perhaps even a calendar to give game date '1037 in the Third Age'

enter_store in store2.c calls draw_cave when exiting the store, it should
save the current screen contents away in memory and then restore from that
saved screen

if type control-C while resting, sometimes the counter is not cleared, happens
often when count less than 10, to fix, should move all I/O code out of signal
handler, it should just set a flag and return

should examine_book(), scrolls(), and spells/prayers work when hallucinating?

change player attributes to counters, things like sustain_stat, etc.
this would greatly simplify calc_bonuses()

should not be able to stun creates which do not move, and creatures
which have no brains

los code used to determine if monsters are visible but not for objects,
this leads to strange situations, when room lights up, one can see all objects
in the room, but must enter the room before can see then monsters

have the monster generator make a table of undead monster indexes, to simplify
summon_undead()

add some unique levels to make it more interesting, mazes, etc.

add a metric option

add diagonal corridors???

add a storage rental shop, so players can save objects until they need them,
but must pay for the priviledge, and have to go back to level 0 to
retrieve the objects

create a safe haven for the player, where hp regen faster, poison/disease
cure faster, and player must be in to win

add amulet of poison resistance, make it a high level item, people would
have to take off amulet of the magi to wear it

add another set of gain stat potions, at about 1550 feet, to encourage
people to go deeper in search of them

add a bank for saving/borrowing money (I don't like this), would rather
make money less plentiful, perhaps make magic items less profitable to
sell?

possible AD&D enhancements
mages can't wear armor and cast at the same time, stealth decreases
when wearing armor (for thieves), priests can't use edged weapons, spell
casting takes time (more than one turn for high level spells?), ranger
attack bonuses, paladin's laying on hands and wealth limits

give females better dexterity, and/or better spell casting ability, and/or
more stealth

Orcs should always appear in groups?

possible balancing enhancements
characters have max stat of 18/50+ initial race/class mod, for example,
human mage has max str of 18/50 - 5 = 18.
increase warrior HP so that a warrior can withstand one breath of any type
frlom any dragon
dex is very important, so everybody should have a chance of getting high
dex values

add option to find code so that it can optionally stop before lighting
	up or entering a room
add otpion to find code so that will enter corridor intersections

Change key-dispatch table in dungeon.c back to ORIGINAL mode.

put shell_out code in OS dependent files, unix.c/msdos.c/etc.

save all levels, problems with the sheer size of doing this, 10K * 50 levels
is 500K total

change stats to straight 1-40 range

replace sets.c with an array ~110*16 with a flag for each type of damage
	faster and smaller than current scheme

add option to loc_symbol so that it can optionally print char to screen,
	most loc_symbol calls feed directly to print()

the look code uses a different algorithm from the los code, is recursive,
	hard to understand, has 3 gotos, I would prefer code more like los
	using the shading ideas of jnh

lose_dex is never called, well, we'd better fix that!

for characters with low dex, should have slight chance of dropping weapon,
maybe less for fighters, more for mages and priests, should also trip
occassionally when running
acid attacks should lower charisma?

the first nasty invisible monster is the Banshee at 1200 feet, so need to
have see invisible items start appearing at about this time, the current
balance seems OK to me though

black mold, and shimmering mold have 00000080 CMOVE flag set which has no
	effect

boots of great mass can be identified by checking the weight display,
should eliminate them and replace with some other type of cursed boots
suggestion: boots of two left feet, (- to dexterity)

add another field to monster_type, treasurep, cloned/multiplyed monsters
	should not have treasure, but if they pick up an object, then
	again let them carry treasure

change randnor from table lookup to 8d99, save 512 bytes for table

remove ASCII dependencies
	many places assume that a-z are consecutive, i.e. 'a'+25 = 'z'
	the hallucination code assumes ascii - randint(95)+31 (misc1.c)

eliminate sscanf calls in ms_misc.c and wizard.c

allow numbers instead of letters in menus, i.e. spell lists, inventory/equip
	lists

don't use num-lock for tunneling in PC version, this is a locking key

characters accumulate too much cash, perhaps do this:
	change OBJ_TOWN_LEVEL from 7 to 17, and change place_gold() in misc2.c
	293c293,294
	<   i = ((randint(dun_level+2)+2)/2.0) - 1;
	---
	> /* NF: Change randint multiplier from (r(d+2)+2)/2 to (r(d+2)+4)/3 */
	>   i = ((randint(dun_level+2)+4)/3.0) - 1;
the fixes above (decrease mithril values ...) are preferable

show time elapsed playing, date character started, and number of turns
elapsed

have option to put inventory/equipment list on one screen

set a timer, and if the game has been idle for 15 minutes, gracefully
save and exit?

new monster suggestions by Don Dodson
Nether Lich: invisible, phases through walls, similar to Emperor Lich in
	other respects
Archer: fires arrows that do normal damage, or poison, or reduce stat
Wizard: Like a sorceror but more powerful.  Casts fireballs, summons all sorts
	of nasties, blindness, and hold person.  Very high saving throw
	and resistant for fire/frost.

balls should affect player if inside radius, unfortunately, this is not
really such a good idea, since the player is often forced to cast to the
next space, would be OK if the player can specify any point for the target
of the spell

when resting, a player should have a chance of not waking up when a monster
enters a room

add wizard command that would create new MORIA_HOU file, since there already
	is a default def for it, otherwise, make days array bss

for HA weapons, p1 is used for both str increase, and sustain stat

rewrite my own sprintf routine that just takes strings %s and integers %d
and nothing else, may be faster/smaller than the library version, or perhaps
have a routine which cats 3 strings together, or 2 strings and an int

age characters before killing them of Ripe-Old-Age

these commands which take a dir should not work when confused,
   bash, closeobject, jamdoor, openobject

monsters need a 'not carry large object' flag in CMOVE, have all chests (type
2), polearms (type 22) and staffs (type 55) be large objects, these should
be rerolled if they occur when only small objects allowed, chests should have
this bit set, also small creatures should have it set: kobolds, mummified
kobolds, greedy little gnomes, scruffy-looking hobbits.

trap names are vague,
   have two names for each trap, a simple search discloses current vague name,
   setting it off, or a find/identify trap gives the long name

allow option of making aux files either hard coded paths, or paths relative
to the executables directory, could then make the aux files relative, put
exe file in same directory as aux files, and start up program with shell
script that cds to aux file direcotry, this makes it easy to keep multiply
moria versions around

allow rerolling after choose race/class

still too slow on i/o, perhaps rewrite to avoid refresh() calls?
	perhaps use only motion optimization stuff?

should we call m_name if spell only applies to visible creatures?

when moving on objects, say what character moved onto (like rogue)

for throw command, ask for direction first (like rogue)

should be able to enchant to-hit to-dam of gauntlets of slaying?
   likewise, enchant toac of HA swords, etc.
either should allow enchant of HA sword toac, or else disenchanter bats
  should not be allowed to reduce it

fix save files to include obj desc, then only need one random number
	generator which can use table program

give rogues detect treasure and detect objects, also give them a chance to
steal objects from monsters

modify 'x' command to show monster hitpoints

replace magic numbers with constants

name objects if use did not identify them

when creature steals and then dies, the stolen item should appear, unless
creature has teleported away in the meantime

always add exp to current and max, instead of just increasing max when current
exceeds it, this would make attacking undead creatures a little more profitable
since you are guaranteed a net gain of exp if you kill it, even if it drains
a lot of EXP from you

allow chests to hold items

have a global variable, savefile field to keep track of the number of times
a character has been resurrected

should not be able to use a two-handed weapon (two-handed sword, pole arm,
bow, crossbow, flail, etc.) at same time as wearing a shield
should be able to also choose to wield two weapons, but with a penalty of
some sort, probably lowered AC

can't cast in any direction, should be able to, should also be able to cast
down at feet (5), should be able to cast area affect spells (balls) at any
point, so that the burst will affect any desired area

Long term stuff, enhancement suggestions:
give player something to do with money, i.e. 1Million gp for HA +10 +10 sword
'flavor' the levels, dragons on one level, undead on another, etc.
what's been discovered list
commands not close enough to rogue style
fixed item lettering in inventory, in-line/cmd-line options?
command line option to print out times open
Y destroy command, allow destroy from equipment list
let o, c, D commands automatically pick direction when they can
give rogue's a chance to steal, e.g. let monsters carry items that they
  pick up, if rogue fails, then monster gets a free hit, otherwise monster
  stays asleep, with a small chance of monster waking up
give magic users a chance at pre identifying scrolls
could use a help system, like VMS version
have multiple character parties, note that almost everything character
	dependent is stored in the py structure already


could reduce the size of the types.h file (and other source files too) if
	eliminate reduce type specifiers, i.e. int32u cmove;\n int32u spells;
	could be int32u cmove,\n        spells;

add color, i.e. red dragons show up as a red 'D', etc

an inn on the town level, in which you must pay to stay, could be used
by those who need to wait to get back into a store, or who want to wait
until a store's inventory changes

when look at monsters, give monster state in addition to monster name, i.e.
"You see a sleeping ancient red dragon."

add code to the get_dir() function so that one can optionally specific a
	hex instead of a direction, i.e. if you enter '.', then program goes
	into a cursor positioning mode, allowing you to move the cursor to
	the spot you want to specify

don't like the player_exp values, the increase is not very even, especially
in the upper levels

cloak of protection is misleading, it has no special features

need documentation on what each spell/prayer/staff/etc does, this is needed
	for priestly spells in particular, since these are non obvious
	also needed for special objects, such as crown of magi

eating elvish waybread for curing can cause a character to become bloated and
	start moving slower, either decrease food value of ew to 5000, or
	increase player food limit to 17500, or combination of both, or perhaps
	change the you are full message, maybe have another message at 7500?,
	or maybe make elvish waybread immune to the slowing effect

monsters should be more intelligent, should know about corridors so that they
don't get stuck in dead ends, or continually retrace their movement

RNG for Moria should have a table shuffle, see Knuth

don't update store inventories across save, unless the save file is at least,
say, an hour old

when monster appears, print its name, may need some work to work reasonably
	with detect spells

Features:
hero/superhero do not subtract hit points when effect wears off
WOR scroll can save you with minus hit points!!
detect monster does not detect invisible monsters (normally)
can hit monsters in walls, but can not cast at them
can not enchant something with negative numbers (i.e. cursed items)
how does armor protect against breath/gas? it doesn't!!!

missing amulets: strength, constitution, intelligence, dexterity
missing rings: gain wisdom, gain charisma
	note that missing rings/amulets are disjoint
missing detect monster potion (feature!)
missing blank scrolls (feature!)
missing staff genocide (feature!)
missing staff mass_genocide (feature!)

D&D Inconsistencies, most of these should not be fixed since that would
	unbalance the game:
priests should not need light for prayers
magic missile should do 1d4+1 per level
detect invisible should last 5 rounds, instead of 1
stinking cloud should be renamed cloudkill
fireball does 1d6 per level, should destroy all paper/wood and melt metal
lightning does 1d6 per level
hold monster 1 round per level of caster
phase door by touching a wall, and end up on other side of the wall
light spells should be mobile
heroism should not work when over level 11, superheroism should not work when
	over level 14
rings can not be used cummulatively, rings or prot have no effect if
	wearing armor
Flame Tongue, +3 versus cold creatures and avian, +4 vs undead
Holy Avenger, +50% on all saving throws
