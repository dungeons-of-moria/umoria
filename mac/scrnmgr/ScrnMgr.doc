The package is pretty heavily built around MPW.  It is specifically
tailored for version 3.0, but should work with 2.0.2.  The only thing
I think you would have to modify for the older version is the SIZE
resource.  Porting the package to other environments is not something
I would recommend.

The make file recognizes two primary targets: ScrnTest - which will
build the test application along with the subroutine package object
file, and Install - which will copy the object files to appropriate
directories.  If you have a non-standard MPW directory structure, you
will want to modify the rules for Install.

I initially built the subroutine package around a model of the IBM PC
screen BIOS calls.  The idea was to take a public domain curses
package for the PC and replace all the BIOS calls with calls to my
package.  Since my ultimate goal was to port the UNIX moria program
which relied on curses, and the only copy of curses I had was the PC
version, this strategy initially seemed to make sense.  Moria, as it
turns out, only calls a few of the curses routines, so I never had to
actually port the whole PC curses package.  It was a lot easier to
just replace the curses calls in moria with direct calls to my
subroutine package.  By reducing the number of software layers I
achieved better performance, anyway.

Still, the internal structure of the package resembles the PC BIOS.  I
keep two large byte arrays to hold the entire screen, one with the
characters, the other with the attributes.  The attributes are
foreground and background color (the eight original quickdraw colors),
underlined, and italicized.  The bulk of the package, at least in
number of functions, is taken up with routines to manipulate these
buffers, either to put data in or take data out.  Whenever the
contents of the buffers are changed, the window is not immediately
updated to reflect the change.  Instead, I "invalidate" the portion of
the window changed.  This is done by using InvalRect(), which causes
the area to be accumulated in the update region of the window, or by
adding the area to an internal representation of the dirty area of the
screen.  This internal representation is less precise than the region
which is kept by quickdraw calls to InvalRect().  It consists of the
beginning and ending dirty area on each screen line.  The latter
method is faster, but the screen changes will only be noticed when a
call to update the screen is explicitly made, as opposed to the idle
routine (see below) catching an update event.  There are two sets of
routines, then, to change the screen buffers.  The ones prefixed with
a 'D' (for delayed update) use the later method.

A program which uses this package, at a minimum, has to call
InitScreenMgr() at the beginning to open the window, call
IdleScreenMgr() frequently in the middle to handle all the standard
mac events (mouse and keyboard events, especially, but also the
MultiFinder stuff as well), and call CloseScreenMgr() at the end.  The
best time to call the idle routine is whenever your program is waiting
for a keystroke.  Another good time is at regular intervals in a heavy
compute loop.  If you do this, you can actually get your program to
run in the background, but all the idle calls will, of course, slow
things down some.  In heavy compute passages, then, you might instead
want to bracket the code with calls to BeginScreenWait() and
EndScreenWait() to change the mouse cursor to a spinning watch.

A description of each routine in the package follows --

int InitScreenMgr(int h, int v, char *title,
	char *resFile, OSType rfCreator, OSType rfType,
	void (*fileMenuProc)(int item),
	void (*appMenuProc)(int item),
	int multiColorFlag);

This routine initializes the package, allocates buffers, and puts the
window on the monitor.  H and v are the dimensions of the screen in
characters.  Title is the window title.  ResFile, rfCreator, and
rfType describe the file to contain the configuration information.
This file will be maintained in the system folder.  It remembers the
position and size of the window, the font size selected, and, if the
screen is only two colors, the user's choices for foreground and
background color.  FileMenuProc points to a routine to be called when
a selection from the file menu is made.  A click in the window's close
box is considered like a selection from the menu, resulting in a call
to fileMenuProc with the item number equal to the constant
closeBoxItem.  AppMenuProc points to a routine to be called when a
selection from the application menu is made.  Both can be NULL, in
which case the subroutine package will handle them as best it can.
MultiColorFlag is non-zero when more than two colors will be displayed
on the screen.

void IdleScreenMgr(void);

This routine handles the macintosh event queue.  It must be called
frequently, or the user will not be able to select from menus, switch
to another program or desk accessory, etc.  It also blinks the screen
cursor.

void ShowScreen(int visible);

Shows or hides the screen window, depending upon the visible flag.

void CloseScreenMgr(void);

Closes the window, deallocates buffers.

void SetScreenQuitProc(void (*quitProc)(void), int willReturnFlag);

Tells the package what routine to call when quit is chosen.  If the
routine pointed to by quitProc will always return (as opposed to doing
something like ExitToShell()), willReturnFlag should be non-zero.

void SetScreenAboutProc(void (*aboutProc)(void));

Allows the standard about box to be overridden.  AboutProc points to a
routine which should be called when the about item is chosen from the
apple menu.

The following routines all manipulate the screen buffers.  Calls
beginning with 'Set' do not move the screen cursor and need to be told
where to begin the operation.  Calls beginning with 'Write' move the
cursor and begin the operation at the current cursor location.  All of
these routines can be prefixed with a 'D' to make changes to the
internal dirty area instead of calling InvalRect().  The internal
dirty area is updated only when a call to UpdateScreen() is made or
some external update event is generated and caught by the idle
routine.

The screen cells are indicated by column (h) and row (v) numbers which
increase from left to right and top to bottom.  Hence the upper left
of the screen is (0, 0) and the bottom right is (h, v) as set by the
call to InitScreenMgr().

void SetScreenChar(char c, int h, int v);

void SetScreenCharAttr(char c, char a, int h, int v);

void WriteScreenChar(char c);

void WriteScreenCharAttr(char c, char a);

Sets the character at (h, v) to c and the attribute to a.

void SetScreenBuffer(char *buffer, int rowBytes,
	Rect *area, int h, int v);

void SetScreenBufferAttr(char *buffer, char a,
	int rowBytes, Rect *area, int h, int v);

void WriteScreenBuffer(char *buffer, int rowBytes, Rect *area);

void WriteScreenBufferAttr(char *buffer, char a,
	int rowBytes, Rect *area);

Sets the block of characters at (h, v) to the contents of buffer and
all the attributes to a.  RowBytes indicates the number of bytes in a
row in buffer.  Area indicates the block of characters to copy,
assuming that the first byte in buffer is at (0, 0).  Note: This means
that the area rectangle is in buffer coordinates, not screen
coordinates.

void SetScreenString(char *str, int h, int v);

void SetScreenStringAttr(char *str, char a, int h, int v);

void WriteScreenString(char *str);

void WriteScreenStringAttr(char *str, char a);

Sets the characters at (h, v) and following to the contents of string
and all the attributes to a.

void SetScreenImage(char *c, char *a, int rowBytes,
	Rect *area, int h, int v);

void WriteScreenImage(char *c, char *a,
	int rowBytes, Rect *area);

Sets the block of characters at (h, v) to the contents of c and the
attributes to the contents of a.  RowBytes indicates the number of
bytes in a row in the c and a buffers.  Area indicates the block of
bytes to copy, assuming that the first byte in the buffers is at (0,
0).  Note: This means that the area rectangle is in buffer
coordinates, not screen coordinates.

void FillScreen(char c, char a, Rect *area);

Fills the part of the screen indicated by area with the character c
and the attribute a.  Area is in screen coordinates.

void EraseScreen(Rect *area);

Fills the part of the screen indicated by area with the blank
character (0x20) and the normal attribute (attrNormal).  Area is in
screen coordinates.

void ScrollScreen(int dh, int dv, Rect *area, char a);

Scrolls the part of the screen indicated by area the distance
indicated by dh and dv (which may be negative).  The leftover space is
filled with the blank character (0x20) and the normal attribute
(attrNormal).  Area is in screen coordinates.

void MoveScreenCursor(int dh, int dv);

Moves the screen cursor by the number of character cells indicated by
dh and dv (which may be negative).

void SetScreenCursor(int h, int v);

Positions the screen cursor at the character cell indicated by h and v.

void DefineScreenCursor(int color, int lines, int blinkRate);

Defines the screen cursor.  Color indicates what you would expect,
lines indicates the height of the cursor in pixels (up to the height
of the character cell, so lines = 32767 will probably give you a block
cursor), and blinkRate indicates the number of clock ticks between
cursor blinks or zero for a non-blinking cursor (a really friendly
program will use GetCaretTime() to set this).  The default cursor uses
black, 2 lines, and no blinks.  It is initially hidden.

void HideScreenCursor(void);

void ShowScreenCursor(void);

An internal counter is used to keep track of whether the cursor is to
be shown on the screen.  When it is less than or equal to zero, the
cursor is hidden.  Otherwise it is shown.  The hide routine decrements
this counter.  Show increments it.

void UpdateScreen(void);

Immediately draws the dirty portion of the screen.  The dirty portion
includes the update region of the window and the internal dirty area
maintained by the 'D' buffer manipulation routines.

In addition to the macintosh event queue, this package maintains a
buffer of keystrokes and mouse clicks.  Whenever the idle routine is
called, the events are pulled out of the macintosh queue and put into
the internal buffer.

void FlushScreenKeys(void);

Flushes the internal buffer of keystrokes and the macintosh event queue.

int CountScreenKeys(void);

Counts the number of entries in the internal keystroke buffer.

int GetScreenKeys(char *keyCode, char *modifiers, char *ascii,
	int *h, int *v);

Pulls the top element off the internal buffer.  KeyCode contains the
keycode as described in the IM Event Manager documentation.  Modifiers
contains bits which indicate the state of the control keys (command,
shift, caps lock, option, and control) and whether the event is a
mouse click.  There are masks defined in ScrnMgr.h that indicate the
exact bit for each.  In the case of a mouse click, h and v will be
set.  If you are not interested in mouse clicks, you can pass NULLs
for both.  Ascii will get the ascii code of the key hit.  If the
keyboard in use has a control key, the ascii value is taken right from
the event which will contain the appropriate control code.  If the
keyboard does not have a control key, a test is made to see if the
command modifier key is down. If so, the ascii value is converted to
the appropriate control code.  See the discussion on MENU resources
below to see how command key equivalents work on machines without a
control key.

void EnableScreenMouse(int flag);

Enables or disables the queuing of mouse clicks in the internal
buffer, according to flag.  Initially, mouse clicks are disabled.

void ClipScreenMouse(Rect *clip);

Limits the detection of mouse clicks to the area indicated by clip,
measured in character cells on the screen.

void GetScreenCharAttr(char *c, char *a, int h, int v);

Returns in c and a the character and attribute at (h, v).

void GetScreenImage(char *c, char *a, int rowBytes,
	Rect *area, int h, int v);

Returns in c and a the block of characters and attributes beginning at
(h, v).  RowBytes indicates the number of bytes in a row in the c and
a buffers.  Area indicates the block of bytes to copy, assuming that
the first byte in the buffers is at (0, 0).  Note: This means that the
area rectangle is in buffer coordinates, not screen coordinates.

void GetScreenCursor(int *h, int *v);

Returns the screen coordinates of the cursor.

The next few routines help with dialogs.  They are designed to work
with multi-monitor systems.  On such systems, the active monitor is
chosen by the current mouse location, arguably not a good choice, but
probably a choice as good as any other.

int YesOrNo(char *question);

Puts up a dialog box with the string pointed to by question, a button
for yes (the default), and a button for no.  Returns true if yes is
selected.  The box will be centered horizontally on the active
monitor, one-third of the way from the top.

int DoScreenALRT(int id, int kind, Fixed hRatio, Fixed vRatio);

Puts up the alert indicated by id.  Kind specifies the type of alert
(normal, stop, note, or caution).  There are constants defined in
ScrnMgr.h for each of these kinds.  The alert will be centered hRatio
of the way from the left and vRatio of the way from the top of the
active monitor.  (I.e., if hRatio = vRatio = .5, the alert will be
exactly in the middle of the screen.)  ScrnMgr.h contains fixed
constants for common ratios.  See IM for a general discussion of fixed
numbers.  Returns the item number of the button pressed.

void CenterScreenDLOG(int id, Fixed hRatio, Fixed vRatio,
	int *h, int *v);

Given a DLOG, which does not have to be currently shown on the screen,
indicated by id, and hRatio and vRatio, returns where to position its
top left corner in h and v.  See DoScreenALRT for an explanation of
hRatio and vRatio.  This routine is generally used prior to calling
GetNewDialog().  You should declare your DLOG to be invisible, call
MoveWindow() using h and v to center it, and then call ShowWindow().

void GetScreenBounds(Rect *bounds);

Returns the bounds in global coordinates of the active monitor, less
the menu bar if it is on this monitor.

pascal void DrawDefaultBorder();

pascal void DrawGroupRect();

Two handy routines for installing in dialog userItems.

void ConfigScreenMgr(int force, ResType theType, int theID,
	int (*configProc)(Handle theData));

A routine to manipulate resources in the configuration file.  Checks
for the presence of the resource indicated by theType and theID.  If
this resource is not found, it does nothing.  If the resource is found
somewhere other than in the configuration file (see InitScreenMgr()),
this routine assumes that some action needs to be taken.  The usual
place other the the configuration file to find this kind of resource
is in the program file itself and logically represents default values.
If some action needs to be taken or force is non-zero, the routine
pointed to by configProc is called.  TheData contains a handle to the
resource found as described above.  ConfigProc should generally put up
a dialog box to change the data in theHandle.  If it does change the
data, configProc should return true.  Otherwise, false.  If configProc
returns true, the handle is marked changed so that it is added to the
configuration file.  A nice time to call this routine is at the start
of your program with force false, so that initial configuration
information can be obtained from the user.  Then provide a menu item
in the application menu to allow the user to change it later, calling
this routine with force true.

void BeginScreenWait(int rate);

Changes the cursor to a spinning wristwatch.  Rate indicates the
number of ticks between each spin.

void EndScreenWait(void);

Returns the cursor to the standard arrow.

Handle GetFileMHandle(void);

Handle GetAppMHandle(void);

Returns a handle to the file or application menu.

int PushScreen();

Saves the current screen buffer (characters, attributes, and cursor
location) on a stack.  Allocates a significant amount of memory.
Returns 0 if successful.

void PopScreen()

Sets the screen contents to the last screen saved by PushScreen().  If
there are no saved screens on the stack, does nothing.

You should include in your application all the resources found in the
file ScrnMgr.rsrc.  This file is produced from ScrnMgr.r by the MPW
tool Rez.  The best way to do this, assuming you have Rez, is to
include at the beginning of your program's .r file, the line 'include
"ScrnMgr.rsrc";'

This package assumes that your program will have 4 or 5 menus: the
Apple, File, Edit, Screen (FontSize), and optionally an "application"
menu.  You can override the standard file menu, if you provide a
fileMenuProc in the InitScreenMgr() call.  If you do override, you
should provide two menu resources to replace the default ones in
ScrnMgr.rsrc.  The first must be MENU(129).  The second, MENU(229),
must be a copy of the first, except for not having any command key
equivalents.  It will be used on machines without a control key.  In
other words, machines without a control key on the keyboard cannot use
command key equivalents.  If you want to implement an application
menu, you must provide an appMenuProc to the initialization routine,
along with MENU(133) and MENU(233).  The first menu is the application
menu with command key equivalents, the second without.

You will probably want to override the STR(128) resource which
contains the title of the first item in the apple menu (i.e, the about
item).  If you override the DLOG(128) and DITL(128) resources, you can
rely on the package to put up your customized about box.  Otherwise,
you can call SetScreenAboutProc() to really customize things.  The
default about box mentions the version of this package and its
programmer.

The STR(129) resource contains the name of the font the package should
use.  Any true monospaced font should work.  Be forewarned that very
few fonts are completely monospaced.  Many have a few odd characters
whose width is not the same as most others.  Since this package relies
on GetFontInfo() and the returned widMax to setup the screen, even the
presence of one extra wide character in the font will cause funny
things to happen.

You will probably want to override the INFO(1) resource.  This
resource contains the window size, position, font size, and colors.  A
copy of it is made the first time your program is run in the
configuration file and is thereafter kept up to date.  Hence, the copy
you keep in you application file should contain the default initial
values.  The window size and position are indicated by a rectangle in
global coordinates.  Since ResEdit does not provide a template for
this kind of resource, you will have to at least look at the ScrnMgr.r
file to see the format of the resource if you want to use ResEdit to
modify it.

Finally, you will want to supply a SIZE resource to make your program
MultiFinder friendly.

I am somewhat ambivalent about releasing this package to the public.
I do not think that it is particularly well-written.  And I certainly
do not think that it does justice to what the mac is all about.  It is
probably full of bugs.  The only real testing that it has had is in
the moria port, which doesn't call all of the routines available.
Hence, I do not provide an express or implied warranty of any kind.
You use the package at your own risk.  If you have any questions, I
can be reached at 73230.224@compuserve.com or at 73230,224 on CIS.
