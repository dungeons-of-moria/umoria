             MORIA

                           MORIA
          player  may  choose  from  a  number  of  races  and classes when
          creating their character, and then 'run' that  character  over  a
          period of days, weeks, even months; attempting to win the game by
          defeating the Balrog which lurks in the deeper levels.

               The player will begin his adventure on the town level  where
          he  may  acquire supplies, weapons, armor, and magical devices by
          bartering with various shop  owners.   After  preparing  for  his
                                                                      MORIA
          where fantastic adventures await his coming!

               Before beginning your first adventure, you should read  this
                                           MORIA
          will require a dedicated player to win.








               ___ _________

               All characters have six main attributes which  modify  their
          basic   abilities.   These  six  attributes,  called  stats,  are
          STRENGTH,  INTELLIGENCE,  WISDOM,  DEXTERITY,  CONSTITUTION,  and
          CHARISMA.   Stats  may  vary  from  3 as a minimum to 18/100 as a
          maximum.  Because adventurers of interest tend to be better  than
                               MORIA
          further  adjusted  by  race  and  class.   Some  races  are  just
          naturally  better  at  being  certain  classes,  as will be shown
          later.

               In addition to the more visible stats,  each  character  has
          certain  abilities  which  are  mainly determined by his race and
          class, but are also modified by his  stats.   The  abilities  are
          FIGHTING,   THROWING/BOWS,   SAVING  THROW,  STEALTH,  DISARMING,
          MAGICAL DEVICES, PERCEPTION, SEARCHING, and INFRA-VISION.

               Characters will be assigned an early history, with money and
          a social class based on that history.  Starting money is assigned
          based on history, charisma, and somewhat upon the  average  of  a
          character's  stats.   A  character  with below average stats will
          receive extra money to help him survive the first adventure.

               Each character will also have physical attributes such as  a
          race, a height, weight, sex, and a physical description.  None of
          these, except weight, play any part in the  game  other  than  to
          give  the  player  a "feeling" for his character.  Weight is used
          for computing carrying capacity and also for BASHING.

               Finally each character is assigned HIT POINTS based on their
          race,  class,  and constitution.  Spell casters will also receive
          "MANA" which is expended when casting spells.  MANA is  based  on
          Wisdom for Priests and Intelligence for Mages.

           The Dungeons of MORIA


          2.1.1  Character Stats -


          STR - Strength

               Strength is important in fighting with weapons, or  hand  to
          hand.   A  high strength can improve your chances of hitting, and
          the amount of damage done with each  hit.   Characters  with  low
          strengths  may  receive  penalties.   Strength  is also useful in
          tunneling, body and shield bashing, and in the carrying of  heavy
          items.


          INT - Intelligence

               Intelligence is the prime stat of a mage,  or  magician.   A
          high  intelligence  increases a mages chances of learning spells,
          and in gaining mana.  No spell  may  be  learned  by  mages  with
          intelligences  under 8.  Intelligence also modifies a character's
          chance of disarming traps and picking locks.


          WIS - Wisdom

               Wisdom is the  prime  stat  of  a  priest.   A  high  wisdom
          increases  the  chance  of  receiving  new spells from a priest's
          diety, and in the  gaining  of  mana.   Wisdom  also  modifies  a
          character's  chance  of  resisting  magical  spells cast upon his
          person.


          DEX - Dexterity

               Dexterity is the combination of agility  and  quickness.   A
          high  dexterity  may allow a character to get multiple blows with
          lighter weapons, thus greatly increasing his kill power, and  may
          increase  his  chances  of hitting with any weapon.  Dexterity is
          also useful in picking locks and disarming traps.


          CON - Constitution

               Constitution is a characters ability  to  resist  damage  to
          their  body,  and  to  recover from damage received.  Therefore a
          character with a high constitution will receive more hit  points,
          and be more resistant to poisons.


          CHR - Charisma

               Charisma represents a character's personality,  as  well  as
          physical  looks.   A  character with a high charisma will receive
          better prices from store owners, whereas a character with a  very
          low  charisma  will  be  robbed blind.  A high charisma will also
          mean more starting money for the character.

          2.1.2  Character Sex -

               You may choose to be either a male or  a  female  character.
          Only height and weight are affected by a character's sex.  Female
          characters tend to be somewhat smaller  and  lighter  then  their
          male counterparts.  No adjustments to stats or abilities are made
          because of the sex of a character.

          2.1.3  Character Abilities -

               Characters possess nine different abilities which  can  help
          them to survive.  The starting abilities of a character are based
          upon race and class.  Abilities may be adjusted by  high  or  low
          stats, and may increase with the level of the character.


            - Fighting

               Fighting is the ability to hit and do damage with weapons or
          fists.   Normally a character gets a single blow from any weapon,
          but if his dexterity and strength are high enough, he may receive
          more   blows  per  round  with  lighter  weapons.   Strength  and
          dexterity both  modify  the  ability  to  hit  an  opponent.   In
          addition this skill increases with the level of the character.


            - Throwing/Bows

               Using stand-off missile  weapons  and  throwing  objects  is
          included  in  this  skill.   Different  stats  apply to different
          weapons, but may modify the distance an object  is  thrown/fired,
          the  amount  of  damage  done, and the ability to hit a creature.
          This skill increases with the level of the character.


            - Saving Throw

               A Saving Throw is the ability of a character to  resist  the
          effects  of a spell cast on him by another person/creature.  Note
          that this does not include spells cast on the player by  his  own
          stupidity,  such  as  quaffing  a  nasty  potion.   This  ability
          increases with the level of the character,  but  then  most  high
          level creatures are better at casting spells, so it tends to even
          out.


            - Stealth

               The  ability  to  move  silently  about  is   very   useful.
          Characters   with   good   stealth  can  usually  surprise  their
          opponents, gaining the first blow.  Also, creatures may  fail  to
          notice  a stealthy character entirely, allowing a player to avoid
          certain fights.


            - Disarming

               Disarming is the  ability  to  remove  traps  (safely),  and
          includes   picking  locks  on  traps  and  doors.   Note  that  a
          successful disarming will gain  the  character  some  experience.
          The  character  must have found a trap before it can be disarmed.
          Dexterity and intelligence both modify the ability to disarm, and
          this ability increases with the level of the character.

           The Dungeons of MORIA


            - Using Magical Devices

               Using a magical device such as  a  wand  or  staff  requires
          experience  and knowledge.  Spell users such as mages and priests
          are therefore much better at using a magical device  than  say  a
          fighter.   This  skill is modified by intelligence, and increases
          with the level of the character.


            - Perception

               Perception  is  the  ability  to  notice  something  without
          actively  seeking it out.  This skill is based entirely upon race
          and class, and will never improve unless magically enhanced.


            - Searching

               To search is to actively look for secret doors, floor traps,
          and  traps  on  chests.   Rogues  are  the best at searching, but
          mages,  rangers,  and  priests  are  good  at  it.   Intelligence
          modifies  your  ability  at searching, and your ability will also
          increase with your level.


            - Infra Vision

               Infra-vision is the ability to see heat sources.  Since most
          of  the  dungeon is cool or cold, infra-vision will not allow the
          player to see walls  and  objects.   Infra-vision  will  allow  a
          character  to  see  any  warm-blooded  creatures  up to a certain
          distance.  This ability works equally well with  or  with  out  a
                                                      MORIA
          cold blooded, and will not be detected unless lit up by  a  light
          source.

                 ________ _ ____

               There are eight different races that you can choose from  in
          MORIA
          be, and each race has it's own adjustments to a character's stats
          and abilities.


            - Human

               The human  is  the  base  character,  all  other  races  are
          compared  to  him.  Human's can choose any class, and are average
          at everything.  Humans tend to go up levels faster than any other
          race, because of their shorter life-spans.  No racial adjustments
          occur to character's choosing human.


            - Half-Elf

               Half-elves tend to be smarter and faster than a  human,  but
          not  as  strong.   Half-elves  are  slightly better at searching,
          disarming, perception, stealth, and magic, but they  are  not  as
          good at hand weapons.  Half-elves may choose any class.


            - Elf

               Elves are better magicians then humans, but not as  good  at
          fighting.   They tend to be smarter and faster than either humans
          or half-elves, and also have better wisdom.  Elves are better  at
          searching,  disarming,  perception,  stealth, and magic, but they
          are not as good at hand weapons.   Elves  may  choose  any  class
          except Paladin.


            - Halfling

               Halflings, or Hobbits, are very good at bows, throwing,  and
          have  good  saving throws.  They also are very good at searching,
          disarming,  perception,  and  stealth;  so  they  make  excellent
          thieves (but prefer to be called burglars...).  They will be much
          weaker than humans, and no good at bashing.  Halflings have  fair
          infra-vision,  so  can  detect  warm  creatures  at  a  distance.
          Halflings can choose between being a fighter, mage, or rogue.


            - Gnome

               Gnomes are smaller than dwarfs, but larger  than  halflings.
          They, like the halflings, live in the earth in burrow-like homes.
          Gnomes are practical jokers, so if they can kill something  in  a
          humorous  way,  so much the better.  Gnomes make excellent mages,
          and have very good saving throws.  They are  good  at  searching,
          disarming,  perception,  and  stealth.  They have lower strengths
          and constitutions then humans  so  they  are  not  very  good  at
          fighting  with  hand  weapons.  Gnomes have fair infra-vision, so
          can detect warm creatures at a  distance.   A  gnome  may  choose
          between being a fighter, mage, priest, or rogue.

           The Dungeons of MORIA


            - Dwarf

               Dwarves are the headstrong miners and  fighters  of  legend.
          Since  dungeons  are  the  natural  home  of  a  dwarf,  they are
          excellent choices for a warrior or priest.  Dwarves  tend  to  be
          stronger,  have  higher  constitutions,  but  are slower and less
          intelligent than humans.  Because they are so headstrong and  are
          somewhat  wise,  they  resist  spells  which  are  cast  on them.
          Dwarves  also  have   good   infra-vision   because   they   live
          underground.  They do have one big draw-back though.  Dwarves are
          loud-mouthed and proud, singing  in  loud  voices,  arguing  with
          themselves  for  no  good  reason,  screaming  out  challenges at
          imagined foes.  In other words, dwarves have a miserable stealth.


            - Half-Orc

               Half-Orcs make excellent fighters, and decent  priests,  but
          are  terrible  at  magic.  They are as bad as dwarves at stealth,
          and horrible at searching, disarming, and perception.   Half-Orcs
          are;  let's  face  it,  ugly.  They tend to pay more for goods in
          town.  Half-Orcs do make good priest's and rogues, for the simple
          reason  that  Half-Orcs tend to have great constitutions and lots
          of hit points.


            - Half-Troll

               Half-Trolls are incredibly strong, and have the highest  hit
          points  of  any  character  race.   They are also very stupid and
          slow.  They will make great fighters and iffy priests.  They  are
          bad  at  searching, disarming, perception, and stealth.  They are
          so ugly that a Half-Orc grimaces in their  presence.   They  also
          happen to be fun to run...

                 ________ _ _____

               Once a race has been chosen, you will need to pick a  class.
          Some classes will not be available to certain races; for instance
          a  Half-Troll  cannot  become  a  Paladin.   For  the  first  few
          adventures  it  is  suggested  that  you  run a warrior or rogue.
          Spell casting generally requires a more experienced  player  that
          is familiar with survival techniques.


            - Warrior

               A Warrior is a hack-and-slash character, who solves most  of
          his  problems  by  cutting  them to pieces, but will occasionally
          fall back on the help of a magical device.  His prime  stats  are
          Strength  and  Constitution, and a good Dexterity can really help
          at times.  A Warrior will be good at Fighting and  Throwing/Bows,
          but bad at most other skills.


            - Mage

               A Mage must live by his wits.  He cannot hope to simply hack
          his  way through the dungeon, and so must therefore use his magic
          to defeat, deceive, confuse, and to escape with.  A mage  is  not
          really  complete without a golf-cart of magical devices to use in
          addition to his spells.  He can master the higher  level  magical
          devices  far  easier  than  anyone  else, and has the best saving
          throw to resist effects of spells cast at him.  Intelligence  and
          Dexterity  are  his  primary stats.  There is no rule that says a
          mage cannot become a good fighter, but spells are his true realm.


            - Priest

               A Priest is a character of holy devotion.  They explore  the
          dungeon  only  to  destroy  the  evil  that  lurks within, and if
          treasure just happens to fall into their  packs;  well,  so  much
          more  to the glory of their church!  Priests receive their spells
          from a diety, and therefore do not choose which spells they  will
          learn.   He  is familiar with magical devices, preferring to call
          them instruments of god, but is not as good as a  mage  in  their
          use.   Priests have good saving throws, and make decent fighters,
          preferring blunt weapons over edged ones.   Wisdom  and  Charisma
          are the priests primary stats.

           The Dungeons of MORIA


            - Rogue

               A Rogue is a character that prefers to live by his  cunning,
          but  is  capable  of fighting his way out of a tight spot.  He is
          the master of traps and locks, no device being impossible for him
          to  over-come.   A rogue has a high stealth allowing him to sneak
          around many creatures without having to fight, or  sneak  up  and
          get  the  first  blow.   A  rogue's perception is higher than any
          other class, and many times he will notice a trap or secret  door
          before  having  to  search.   A  rogue is better than warriors or
          paladins with magical devices, but still can not  rely  on  their
          performance.   A  rogue's  primary  stats  are  Intelligence  and
          Dexterity.


            - Ranger

               A Ranger is a fighter/mage.  He is a good fighter,  and  the
          best  of  the  classes  with a missile weapon such as a bow.  The
          ranger learns spells much more slowly than a mage, but is capable
          of learning all but the most powerful spell.  Because a ranger is
          really a dual class character, it  requires  more  experience  to
          advance  him.  A ranger has a good stealth, good perception, good
          searching, a good saving throw, and is good with magical devices.
          His primary stats are Intelligence and Dexterity.


            - Paladin

               A Paladin is a fighter/priest.  He is a very  good  fighter,
          second  only  to  the warrior class, but not very good at missile
          weapons.  He receives prayers at a slower pace then  the  priest,
          and  can  receive  all  but  the most powerful prayer.  Because a
          paladin is really  a  dual  class  character,  it  requires  more
          experience  to  advance  him.  A paladin lacks much in the way of
          abilities.  He is poor at  stealth,  perception,  searching,  and
          magical  devices.  He has a decent saving throw due to his divine
          alliance.  His primary stats are Strength and Charisma.

               All commands are  entered  by  pressing  a  single  key,  or
          control  sequence  (holding down the control key while pressing a
          key).  If a particular command  requires  additional  action,  it
          will  be  prompted  for, with one exception.  When a direction is
          required, no prompt is given unless and until an illegal response
          is given.



          2.2.2.1  Note On <Dir> -

               In the following instructions, the symbol <Dir> refers to  a
          numeric  direction  based on your keypad.  It is not valid to use
          the number '5' in this context.  One exception to  this  is  with
          movement, in which case '5' will rest the character for one turn.

               Commands which require a direction will not prompt  you  for
          one,  unless  you  input  an  illegal  direction.   Just  enter a
          direction after the entering the command.

            Movement

               Movement is  accomplished  by  using  your  numeric  keypad.
          Simply  press  a  number and your character will move one step in
          that direction.  Pressing a '5' is equivalent to waiting for  one
          round  (More  efficient  resting  over  long  periods  of time is
          accomplished by using the Rest command).  You can only move  onto
          and through floor spots, and only if they contain no creatures or
          obstructing objects such as a closed door.

               Moving your character  one  step  at  a  time  can  be  time
          consuming  and  boring, so a faster method has been supplied.  By
          using the Move command '.', you may move  in  a  direction  until
          something  interesting  happens.   For  instance, by pressing the
          period key '.' followed by the direction 8, your character  would
          continue  to  move  up the screen, only coming to a stop after at
          least one condition is satisfied.  These conditions are:

          1.  A creature appears upon the screen, or a creature already  on
              the screen moves.

          2.  You move next to an  object,  or  feature  such  as  a  door,
              staircase, or trap.

          3.  You come to  a  wall,  and  have  more  than  one  choice  of
              directions  from  which  to  continue,  or  are  in a dead in
              passage.

          4.  You come to a junction of several passages.

            B <Dir> - Bash

               The Bash command includes breaking open doors and chests, or
          bashing an opponent.  Two main factors determine the ability of a
          character to bash; their weight and their strength.  In addition,
          when bashing an opponent, you will either perform a body bash, or
          if wielding a  shield,  perform  a  shield  bash  which  is  more
          effective.

               Bashing a door can throw the character off-balance, but this
          will  not  generally  be  a problem.  Doors that have been jammed
          closed with spikes can only be opened by bashing.   Locked  doors
          may  also  be  bashed  open.   Note that bashing a door open will
          permanently break it.

               Bashing a creature has effects on both the  player  and  his
          opponent.   Depending  on  a character's dexterity, he may or may
          not be thrown off-balance allowing free moves to  his  opponents.

                                       16

           The Dungeons of MORIA


          If   the   bash  is  successful,  the  opponent  will  be  thrown
          off-balance for 1 to 3 turns, thus allowing  the  character  free
          hits or a chance to run.

               A player automatically performs a shield bash instead  of  a
          body  bash,  if  he is currently wearing a shield.  A shield bash
          adds the damage of a shield to that  of  the  bash,  so  is  more
          effective.   Note  that  size and material both affect the damage
          that a shield will do.


            C       - Print character (to screen or file)

               This  command  allows  the  player  to  either  display  his
          character on the terminal screen, or to print an entire character
          info listing to a file.  If printed to a file, history, equipment
          list, and an inventory list are included.


            D <Dir> - Disarm a trap.

               You can attempt to disarm floor traps,  or  trapped  chests.
          If  you fail to disarm a trap, there is a chance that you blunder
          and set it off.  You can only disarm a  trap  on  a  chest  after
          finding it with the search command.


            E       - Eat some food.

               A character must eat occasionally to remain effective.  As a
          character  grows  hungry,  a message will appear at the bottom of
          the screen saying "Hungry".  If a character remains  hungry  long
          enough, he will become weak and eventually start fainting.


            F       - Fill a lamp or lantern with oil.

               If your character is currently using a lamp for  light,  and
          if  he has a flask of oil in inventory, he may refill the lamp by
          using this command.  A lamp is capable of a maximum of 5500 turns
          of light, and each flask has 5000 turns of oil contained in it.


            L       - Display map co-ordinates.

               The Location command will display your  character's  current
          co-ordinates  as  shown  on  a  printed map (printed with the 'P'
          command).  Sectors contain up to 44 rows by 99 columns each.  The
          Location  command  will  display  the character's current row and
          column map co-ordinates, as well as the sector number.


            P       - Print map to file.

               The Print command will write an entire map  of  the  dungeon
          floor  explored to a file.  Since the dungeon floor is large, the
          map is broken up into sectors, each containing up to 44  rows  by
          99 columns.


                                       17

           The Dungeons of MORIA


            R       - Rest for a number of turns.

               You may rest one turn by pressing the '5' key.  Resting  for
          longer periods of time is accomplished by using the Rest command,
          followed by the number of turns you want to rest your  character.
          Resting  will  continue until the specified duration has expired,
          or something to wake the character happens, such  as  a  creature
          wandering  by.   It  is  sometimes  a good idea to rest a beat-up
          character until he regains some of his hit points, but be sure to
          have plenty of food if you rest often.

               If you have accidently entered in a rest period  too  large,
          or  change  your mind about the resting period, you may wake your
          character up by pressing any key.


            S       - Search mode toggle.

               The Searching toggle will take the character into and out of
          searching mode.  When first pressed, the message "Searching" will
          appear at the bottom of the screen.  The character is now  taking
          two  turns  for each command, one for the command and one turn to
          search about him.  Note that this means he is  taking  twice  the
          time to move about the dungeon, and therefore twice the food.  If
          a creature should happen by  or  attack  you,  search  mode  will
          automatically  shut  off.  Otherwise you may turn off search mode
          by again pressing the 'S' key.


            T <Dir> - Tunnel through rock.

               Tunneling (Mining) is a very useful  art.   There  are  four
          kinds of rock present in the dungeons of *MORIA*; Permanent Rock,
          Granite Rock, Magma Intrusion, and Quartz Veins.  Permanent  Rock
          is exactly that, permanent.  Granite is very hard, therefore hard
          to dig through, and  contains  no  valuable  metals.   Magma  and
          Quartz  veins  are  softer and sometimes bare valuable metals and
          gems, shown as a '$' or a '*' character.  You  can  tell  if  the
          metal  or  gems are embedded into the wall by trying to move onto
          them.  If you can't move over them, you'll have to dig them out.

               Tunneling can be VERY difficult by hand, so when you dig  be
          sure  to  wield  either  a shovel or a pick.  Magical shovels and
          picks can be found which allow the wielder  to  dig  much  faster
          than normal, and a good strength also helps.

               It is sometimes possible to get a character  trapped  within
          the  dungeon by using various magical spells and items.  So it is
          a very good idea to always carry some kind of digging tool,  even
          when you are not planning on tunneling for treasure.


            a <Dir> - Aim a wand.

               Wands must be aimed in a direction to be used.  Wands are  a
          magical  device  and therefore use the Magical Devices ability of
          the player.  They will either affect  the  first  object/creature
          encountered,  or  affect anything in a given direction, depending
          upon the wand.  An obstruction such as door or wall will  general

          stop the effects of a wand from traveling further.


            b       - Browse a book.

               You can  only  read  a  book  if  you  are  of  it's  realm.
          Therefore  a  magic  user could read a magic book, but not a holy
          book.  Fighter's will not be able to read either  kind  of  book.
          When  the  browse  command  is used, all of the spells or prayers
          contained in the book along with information about  it,  such  as
          it's level, the amount of mana used up in casting it, and whether
          or not you know the spell or prayer, will  be  displayed.   There
          are  a total of 31 different magical spells in four books, and 31
          different prayers in four books.


            c <Dir> - Close a door.

               Non-intelligent and certain other creatures will not be able
          to  open  a  door.  Therefore shutting doors can be a life saver.
          You must be adjacent to an open door, and you cannot close broken
          doors.  Note that bashing a door open will break it.


            d       - Drop an object from you inventory.

               You can drop a single object onto the floor beneath  you  if
          that  floor  spot  does not already contain an object.  Note that
          doors and traps are considered objects in  this  sense.   If  you
          drop  an  object  such  as  a  potion  or scroll, a single one is
          dropped onto the floor at a time.  Group objects such  as  arrows
          are all dropped at once onto the floor.


            e       - Display a list of equipment being used.

               Use the Equipment command  to  display  a  list  of  objects
          currently  being  used  by your character.  Note that each object
          has a specific place were it is placed, and that only one  object
          of  each  type  may  be  used at any one time; excepting rings of
          which two can be worn, one on each hand.


            f <Dir> - Throw an object/Use a missile weapon.

               You  may  throw  any  object  carried  by  your   character.
          Depending  upon  the  weight of an object, it may travel across a
          room or drop down beside you.  If you throw an object such as  an
          arrow, only one will be used at a time.

               If you throw at a  creature,  your  chance  of  hitting  the
          creature  is  determined  by  your pluses to hit, your ability at
          throwing, and the objects pluses to hit.  Once  the  creature  is
          hit,  the  object  may  or  may  not  do any actual damage to it.
          Certain objects in the dungeon can do  great  amounts  of  damage
          when  thrown,  but  it's  for you to figure out the obscure ones.
          Oil flasks are considered to be lit before thrown, therefore they
          will do fire damage to a creature if they hit it.

           The Dungeons of MORIA


               To use a bow with arrows, simply wield the bow and throw the
          arrows.   Extra  pluses  to  damage  and  hitting  are  gained by
          wielding the proper weapon and throwing the  corresponding  ammo.
          A heavy crossbow with bolts for example, is a killer...


            h       - Enter the MORIA

               A subprocess is spawned and the HELP utility entered.   Help
          on  individual commands may be displayed without actually exiting
          your game.  You may return to your game by entering a <CONTORL>-Z
          character.


            i       - Display a list of objects being carried.

               The Inventory command displays a list of all  objects  being
          carried,  but  are  not  in  current use.  You may carry up to 22
          different kinds of objects, not including those in your equipment
          list.   Depending upon your strength, you will be able carry many
          identical objects before hitting your weight limit.


            j <Dir> - Jam a door with an iron spike.

               Most humanoid and many intelligent creatures can simply open
          a  closed  door,  and  can  eventually get through a locked door.
          Therefore you may spike a door in order to jam  it.   Each  spike
          used  on  a door will increase it's strength.  It is very easy to
          jam a door so much as to make it impossible for your character to
          bash  it  down,  so  spike  doors wisely.  Note that the bigger a
          creature is, the easier it can bash a door down.  Therefore  four
          or  more  spikes  might be necessary to slow down a dragon, where
          one spike would slow down a kobold.


            m       - Cast a magic spell.

               First, a character must have learned a spell before  he  can
          cast it.  Next, when casting a spell, he must read the spell from
          a book, so a book containing the spell must be in his  inventory.
          Each  spell has a chance of failure which starts out fairly large
          but decreases as a character gains levels.  If a  character  does
          not  have the available mana, he increases his chance of failure,
          and gambles on losing a point of constitution.  Note that since a
          character  must read the spell from a book, he cannot be blind or
          confused when casting a spell,  and  there  must  be  some  light
          present.


            l <Dir> - Look in a direction.

               The Look command is useful in identifying the exact type  of
          object  or  creature shown on the screen.  Also, if a creature is
          on top of an object, the look command will  describe  both.   You
          can  see  creatures  and  objects up to 200 feet away (20 units).
          Note that you  may  freely  use  the  Look  command  without  the
          creatures getting a move on you.


                                       20

           The Dungeons of MORIA


            o <Dir> - Open a door, chest, or lock.

               To open an object such as a door or chest you must  use  the
          Open  command.   If  the  object is locked, the Open command will
          attempt to pick the lock, based on  your  ability  at  disarming.
          Note  that if an object is trapped and you open it, the trap will
          be set off.


            p       - Read a prayer.

               First, a character must have learned a prayer before he  can
          read  it.   Next,  when  reading  a prayer, he must have the book
          containing the prayer in his inventory.  Each prayer has a chance
          of  failure  which  starts  out  fairly  large but decreases as a
          character gains  levels.   If  a  character  does  not  have  the
          available  mana,  he increases his chance of failure, and gambles
          on losing a point of constitution.  Note that since  a  character
          must  read the prayer from a book, he cannot be blind or confused
          and there must be some light present.


            q       - Quaff a potion.

               To drink a potion use the Quaff command.  A  potion  affects
          the  player  in  some  manner.   The effects of the potion may be
          immediately noticed, or they may be subtle and unnoticed.


            r       - Read a scroll.

               To read a scroll use the Read command.  A scroll  spell  has
          an  area  affect,  except in a few cases such as identify scrolls
          which act on other objects.  Note that two scrolls, the  identify
          scroll  and  the  recharge  scroll, have titles which can be read
          without setting them off, and by pressing <ESCAPE> can  be  saved
          for future use.


            s       - Search general area one turn.

               The Search command can be used to locate  hidden  traps  and
          secret doors about the player.  Note that more than a single turn
          of searching will be required in most cases.  You  should  always
          search  a  chest  before  trying  to  open  it  because  they are
          generally trapped.


            t       - Take off a piece of equipment.

               Use the Take-Off command to remove an object from  use,  and
          return  it  to  your inventory.  Occasionally you will run into a
          cursed item which cannot be removed.   Cursed  items  are  always
          bad, and can only be taken off after removing the curse.


            u       - Use a staff.



                                       21

           The Dungeons of MORIA


               The Use command will activate a staff.  Like  scrolls,  most
          staffs  have  an  area affect.  Because staffs are generally more
          powerful than most other items,  they  are  also  harder  to  use
          correctly.


            v       - Display current version of game.

               The Version command displays the  credits  for  the  current
                     MORIA


            w       - Wear or wield an item being carried.

               To wear or wield  an  object  in  your  inventory,  use  the
          Wear/Wield  command.  If an object is already in use for the same
          function, it  is  automatically  removed  first.   Note  that  an
          objects bonuses cannot be gained until it is worn or wielded.


            x       - Exchange primary and secondary weapons.

               A secondary weapon is any weapon which may be needed  often.
          Instead  of  searching  through  your  inventory, you may use the
          exchange command to keep the weapon ready.  For instance, if  you
          wanted  to  use your bow most of the time, but needed a sword for
          close combat, you  could  wield  your  sword,  use  the  exchange
          command to make it the secondary weapon, then wield your bow.  If
          the sword was suddenly needed, simply use the exchange command to
          switch between the bow and the sword.


            /       - Identify a character shown on screen.

               Use the identify  command  to  find  out  what  a  character
          displayed  on  the  screen stands for.  For instance, by pressing
          '/.', you can find out that the '.'  stands  for  a  floor  spot.
          When  used  with  a  creature, the identify command will tell you
          only what class of  creature  the  symbol  stands  for,  not  the
          specific  creature,  therefore  use  the  look  command  for this
          information.


            ?       - Display a list of commands.

               The ?  command displays a one page quick reference help page
          on the screen.


            M      - Repeat last message.

               The <Control>-M (Carriage-Return or Enter key) command  will
          re-display  the  last  message printed on the message line at the
          top of your screen.


            R      - Redraw the screen.



                                       22

           The Dungeons of MORIA


               To redraw the entire screen, use the <Control>-R command.


            Y      - Quit the game without saving.

               To exit the game  without  saving  your  character  use  the
          <Control>-Y  command.  Once exited in this manner, your character
          is non-recoverable.


            Z      - Save your character and quit the game.

               To save your game so that it can be restarted later, use the
          <Control>-Z  command.   The save file can be moved about at will,
          but do not edit it.  Note that a copy of a saved  character  will
          not work after that character has died.


            $       - Shell out of game.

               Use the Shell command '$' to temporarily exit  the  game  to
          execute  DCL  commands.   You  may  re-enter the game by entering
          "EOJ" to end the spawned process.


            <       - Go up an up-staircase.

               If you move onto an up-staircase you may use the '<' command
          to  go  up  one level.  There is always one staircase going up on
          every level except for the town level (this does  not  mean  it's
          easy  to  find).   Going up a staircase will always take you to a
          new dungeon area except for the town  level,  which  remains  the
          same for the duration of your character.


            >       - Go down a down-staircase.

               If you are on top of a down-staircase you may  use  the  '>'
          command  to  go  down  one  level.  There are always two or three
          staircases going down on each level, except the town level  which
          has  only  one.  Going down will always take you to a new dungeon
          area.


            . <Dir> - Move in direction.

               The  Move  command  '.'  will  move  you  in  the  indicated
          direction   until   one  of  several  conditions  happen.   These
          conditions  include,  a  creature  appearing  on  the  screen,  a
          creature  already on the screen moving, an object or feature such
          as a door, a staircase, or a trap is adjacent to  the  character,
          character  comes  into a junction of passages, or character comes
          to a wall with no choice or more than one  choice  of  continuing
          directions.

          2.2.3  The Town Level -

               The town level is where you will begin your adventure.   The
          town  consists of six buildings each with an entrance, some towns
          'people', and a wall which surrounds the town.   The  first  time
          you  are  in  town it will be daytime, but you may return to find
          that darkness  has  fallen.   (Note  that  some  spells  may  act
          differently in the town level.)



          2.2.3.1  Town's People -

               The town contains many different kinds of people.  There are
          the street urchins, young children who will mob an adventurer for
          money, and seem  to  come  out  of  the  woodwork  when  excited.
          Blubbering Idiots which are a constant annoyance, but not harmful.
          Public drunks which wander about the town singing, and are of  no
          threat to anyone.  Sneaky rogues, which hang about watching for a
          likely victim to mug.  And finally, what town would  be  complete
          without  a  swarm  of  half  drunk  warriors, who take offense or
          become annoyed just for the fun of it.

               Most of the towns people should be avoided  by  the  largest
          possible  distance  when  you wander from store to store.  Fights
          will break out though, so be prepared.  Since your character grew
          up  in  this  world  of  intrigue,  no  experience is awarded for
          killing on the town level.



          2.2.3.2  Supplies -

               Your character will begin his adventure with  some  supplies
          already  on  him.   Use  the  Inventory 'i' command to check what
          these supplies are.  It will be necessary to buy  other  supplies
          before  continuing into the dungeon, however, so be sure to enter
          each of the stores.



          2.2.3.3  Town Buildings -

               You may enter any of the  stores,  if  they  are  open,  and
          barter  with  the  owner for items you can afford.  But be warned
          that the owners can easily be insulted, and may  even  throw  you
          out  for a while if you insult them too often.  To enter a store,
          simply move onto  the  entrance  represented  by  the  numbers  1
          through 6.

               Once inside a store, his inventory will appear on the screen
          along  with  a set of options for your character.  You may browse
          the store's inventory if it takes more than one page to  display,
          and  you  may  sell  or purchase items in his inventory.  You can
          execute your inventory and equipment commands to see what you are
          carrying.  Not shown with the options are the wear, take-off, and
          exchange commands which will also work, but were excluded to keep
          the options simple.


                                       25

           The Dungeons of MORIA


               Stores do not always have everything in stock.  As the  game
          progresses,  they  may  get new items so check from time to time.
          Also, if you sell them an item, it may get  sold  to  a  customer
          while  you  are  adventuring so don't always expect to be able to
          get back anything you have sold.

               Store owners will not buy harmful or useless items.   If  an
          object is unidentified, they will pay you some base price for it.
          Once they have bought  it  they  will  immediately  identify  the
          object.   If  it  is  a  good  object,  they will add it to their
          inventory.  If it was a bad bargain, they simply throw  the  item
          away.   In  any  case,  you  may receive some knowledge of the if
          another is encountered.

          2.2.4  Within The Dungeon -

               Once your character is adequately supplied with food, light,
          armor,  and  weapons,  he is ready to enter the dungeon.  Move on
          top of the '>'  symbol  and  use  the  down  '>'  command.   Your
          character enters a maze of interconnecting staircases and finally
          passes through a one-way door.  He is now on the first  level  of
          the  dungeon  (50  feet),  and  must  survive  many  horrible and
          challenging encounters to find the treasure lying about.



          2.2.4.1  Light -

               There are two sources for light  once  inside  the  dungeon.
          Permanent light which has been magically placed within rooms, and
          a light source carried by the player.  If neither is present, the
          character  will  be  unable to map or see any attackers.  Lack of
          light will also affect searching, picking locks, and disarming.

               A character must wield a torch or lamp in  order  to  supply
          his  own  light.   Once a torch or lamp has only 50 or less turns
          left before burning out, the message "Your light is getting  low"
          will  be  displayed  at  random intervals.  Once a torch is burnt
          out, it is useless and can be dropped.  A lamp or lantern can  be
          refilled  with  oil  by  using the Fill 'F' command.  You must of
          course be carrying extra oil to refill a lantern.



          2.2.4.2  Attacking And Being Attacked -

                                      MORIA
          you  attack  him.   You  can  attack  from a distance by firing a
          missile, or by magical means such as aiming  a  wand.   Creatures
          attack  in  the same way, if they move into you, they attack you.
          Some creatures can cast spells from a distance, and  dragon  type
          creatures  can  breath  from  a  distance, but these are the only
          exceptions.

               If you are wielding a weapon, the damage for the  weapon  is
          used  when you hit the creature.  If you are wielding no weapons,
          you get two fist strikes.  Note that very strong creatures can do
          a  lot  of  damage  with  their  fists...  A character may have a
          primary and secondary weapon.  A secondary weapon is kept on  the
          belt,  or  on  the  shoulder  for  immediate use.  You can switch
          between your primary and  secondary  weapons  by  using  the  'x'
          command.   Be  sure  you  are  wielding  the  proper  weapon when
          fighting.  Hitting a dragon over the head with a bow will  simply
          make him mad, and get you killed.

               Missile weapons, such as bows, can be wielded, and then  the
          proper  missile,  in  this case an arrow, can be fired across the
          room into a target.  Missiles can  be  used  without  the  proper
          missile  weapon,  but used together they have a greater range and
          do far more damage.




                                       27

           The Dungeons of MORIA


               Hits and misses are determined by ability to  hit  VS  armor
          class.   A  miss  doesn't  necessarily mean you failed to hit the
          target, but only that you failed to do any damage.   Therefore  a
          'hit'  is  a  strike that does some damage.  Higher armor classes
          make it harder to do damage, therefore more misses.



          2.2.4.2.1  Your Weapon -

               Carrying a weapon in your backpack does you  no  good.   You
          must  wield a weapon before it can be used in a fight.  Note that
          a secondary weapon can be kept by wielding it and then using  the
          exchange  command  'x'.  A secondary weapon is not in use, simply
          ready to be switched with the current weapon if needed.

               Weapons have two main characteristics; their ability to  hit
          and their ability to do damage, expressed as '(+ ,+ )'.  A normal
                                                       MORIA
          bonuses  to  hit  and/or do damage.  Some weapons are cursed, and
          have penalties that hurt the player.   Note  that  cursed  swords
          cannot be un-wielded until the curse is lifted.

               Missile  weapons,  such  as  bows,  have  only   one   major
          characteristic  which  is to hit, expressed '(+ )'.  This plus to
          hit is  added  to  that  of  the  missile  used,  if  the  proper
          weapon/missiles combination are used.

               Although you receive any  magical  bonuses  an  unidentified
          weapon  may  possess when you wield it, those bonuses will not be
          added in to the displayed values of to-hit  and  to-dam  on  your
          character  sheet.   You  must  identify  the  weapon  before  the
          displayed values reflect the real values used.

               Finally, some rare weapons have special abilities.  This are
          called  ego  weapons,  and  are feared by great and meek.  An ego
          sword must be wielded to receive benefit of it's abilities.

               Special weapons are denoted by the following abbreviations:

          1.  (DF) - Defender.

                   A magical weapon that actually helps the wielder  defend
              himself, thus increasing his armor class.

          2.  (FB) - Frost Brand.

                   A magical weapon of ice that delivers a cold critical to
              heat based creatures.

          3.  (FT) - Flame Tongue.

                   A magical weapon of flame that delivers a heat  critical
              to cold based creatures.

          4.  (HA) - Holy Avenger.




                                       28

           The Dungeons of MORIA


                   A Holy Avenger is by far the most powerful  of  weapons.
              Holy  Avengers  have  been  known  to increase several of the
              wielder's stats, to actually  increase  the  wielder's  armor
              class (because of the terror the weapon spawns in it's foes),
              and to actually help the wielder to fight more effectively.

          5.  (SD) - Slay Dragon.

                   A Slay Dragon weapon is a special purpose  weapon  whose
              sole  intent is to destroy dragon-kind.  Therefore, when used
              against a dragon,  the  amount  of  damage  done  is  greatly
              increased.

          6.  (SE) - Slay Evil.

                   A Slay Evil weapon is a  special  purpose  weapon  whose
              sole  intent  is  to  destroy  all  forms of evil.  When used
              against an evil creature, either alive or undead, the  damage
              done is greatly increased.

          7.  (SM) - Slay Monster.

                   A Slay Monster weapon is a special purpose weapon  whose
              sole intent is to destroy all the vile monsters of the world.
              A  monster  is  any  creature  not  natural  to  the   world.
              Therefore  an orc would be a monster, but a giant snake would
              not be.

          8.  (SU) - Slay Undead.

                   A Slay Undead weapon is a special purpose  weapon  whose
              sole  intent  is to destroy all forms of undead.  This weapon
              is hated and feared by the intelligent undead, for  a  single
              blow from this weapon is capable of destroying them.




          2.2.4.2.2  Body And Shield Bashes -

               Weight  is  the  primary  factor  in  being  able  to   bash
          something,  but  strength  plays  a  role  too.  After bashing, a
          character may be off balance for several  rounds  depending  upon
          his DEXTERITY.

               Doors can be broken down by bashing them.  Once  a  door  is
          bashed open, it is forever useless and cannot be closed.

               Chests too may be  bashed  open,  but  be  warned  that  the
          careless  smashing  of a chest often ruins the contents.  Bashing
          open a chest will not disarm any traps it may contain,  but  does
          allow the strong and ignorant to see whats inside.

               Finally, a creature may be bashed.  If a shield is currently
          being  worn,  the  bash is a shield bash and will do more damage.
          In either case, a bash may throw an opponent off  balance  for  a
          number of rounds, allowing a player to get in a free hit or more.
          If the player is thrown off-balance, his opponent  may  get  free
          hits on him.  This is a risky attack.

          2.2.4.2.3  Your Armor Class -

               Armor class is a number that describes the  amount  and  the
          quality of armor begin worn.  Armor class will generally run from
          about 0 to 40, but could become negative or greater  than  40  in
          rare cases.

               The larger your armor class, the more protective it  is.   A
          negative  armor  class  would  actually  help get you hit.  Armor
          protects you in three manners.  One, it makes you  harder  to  be
          hit for damage.  A hit for no damage is the same as a miss.  Two,
          good armor will absorb some of the  damage  that  your  character
          would  have  taken.  An armor class of 30 would absorb 30% of any
          damage meant for him.  Three, fire and acid damage are reduced by
          wearing  body  armor.  It is obvious that a high armor class is a
                                                 MORIA

               Each piece of armor has an armor  class  adjustment,  and  a
          magical  bonus.   Armor  bought  in  town  will have these values
          displayed with their description.  Armor that is found within the
          dungeon must be identified before these values will be displayed.
          Armor class values are always displayed between a set of  brackets
          '[ ,+ ]'.   The  first value is the armor class of the item.  The
          second number is the magical bonus of the item, and  will  always
          have a sign preceding the value.  There are a few cases where the
          form '[+ ]' is used, meaning the object has no armor class,  only
          a magical armor bonus if worn.

               Some pieces of armor will possess special  abilities  denoted
          by the following abbreviations:

          1.  (RA) - Resist Acid.

                   This magical ability is usually  enchanted  into  armor,
              but  may  occasionally be found as an ability of a weapon.  A
              character using such an  object  will  take  only  a  quarter
              damage  from any acid thrown upon him.  In addition, armor so
              enchanted will resist the acid's effects and not  be  damaged
              by it.

          2.  (RC) - Resist Cold.

                   This magical ability is also found in both  weapons  and
              armor.  A character using a resist cold object will take only
              half damage from frost and cold.

          3.  (RF) - Resist Fire.

                   This magical ability is found in both weapons and armor.
              A  character  using  a  resist fire object will take only one
              quarter damage from heat and fire.

          4.  (RL) - Resist Lightning.

                   This magical ability is found in both weapons and armor.
              A  character  using  a resist lightning object will take only
              one quarter damage from electrical attacks.

           The Dungeons of MORIA


          5.  (R) - Resistance.

                   This  magical  ability  is  found  only  in  armor.    A
              character   wearing   armor   with  this  ability  will  have
              resistance to Acid, Cold, Fire, and Lightning as explained in
              each part above.




          2.2.4.3  Objects Found In The Dungeon -

               The mines are full of objects just waiting to be  picked  up
          and  used.   How  did  they get there?  Well, the main source for
          useful items are all the foolish adventurers that proceeded  into
          the  dungeon  before  you.   They  get  killed,  and  the helpful
          monsters scatter the various  treasure  throughout  the  dungeon.
          Most  cursed items are placed there by the joyful evil sorcerers,
          who enjoy a good joke when it gets you killed.

               You pick up objects by moving on top of them.  You can carry
          up  to  22  different  items  in  your backpack while wearing and
          wielding many others.  Note that although you are limited  to  22
          different  items,  you  may  be  carrying  several  of  each item
          restricted only by the amount of weight your character can carry.
          Your  character's  weight  limit  is  determined by his Strength.
          Only one object may occupy any one given  floor  location,  which
          may or may not also contain one monster.  Note that doors, traps,
          and staircases are considered objects for this purpose.

               Many objects found within the dungeon have special  commands
          for their use.  Wands must be Aimed, staves must be Used, scrolls
          must be Read, and potions must be Quaffed.  In any case, you must
          first  be  able  to  carry an object before you can use it.  Some
          objects, such as chests, are very complex.  Chests contain  other
          objects  and  may  be  trapped,  and/or locked.  Read the list of
          player commands carefully for a further understanding of chests.

               One item in particular will be discussed here.   The  scroll
          of "Word of Recall" can be found within the dungeon, or bought at
          the temple in town.  It acts in two manners, depending upon  your
          current  location.   If read within the dungeon, it will teleport
          you back to town.  If read in town, it  will  teleport  you  back
          down to the deepest level of the dungeon one which your character
          has previously been.  This  makes  the  scroll  very  useful  for
                                                MORIA
          been read it takes a while for the spell to act, so don't  expect
          it to save you in a crisis.

               And lastly, a final warning.  Not all objects are what  they
          seem.   Skeletons  lying  peacefully  about the dungeon have been
          known to get up...



          2.2.4.4  Cursed Objects -




                                       31

           The Dungeons of MORIA


               Some objects, mainly armor and weapons, have had curses laid
          upon  them.   These  horrible  objects  will  look like any other
          normal item, but will  detract  from  your  characters  stats  or
          abilities  if worn.  They will also be impossible to remove until
          a remove curse is done.

               When a cursed item has been identified, an asterisk '*' will
          appear  next  to the inventory letter of the item.  If you should
          wear a cursed item, you will immediately know it  is  cursed  and
          again the asterisk will appear.



          2.2.4.5  Mining -

               Much of the treasure within the dungeon can be found only by
          mining  it out of the walls.  Many rich strikes exist within each
          level, but must  be  found  and  mined.   Quartz  veins  are  the
          richest,  yielding the most metals and gems, but magma veins will
          have some hordes hidden within.

               Mining is virtually impossible without  a  pick  or  shovel.
          Picks and shovels have an additional magical ability expressed as
          '(+ )'.  The higher the number, the better  the  magical  digging
          ability of the tool.  Note that a pick or shovel also has plusses
          to hit and damage, and can be used as a weapon.

               When a vein of quartz or magma  is  located,  the  character
          should  wield his pick or shovel and begin digging out a section.
          When that section is removed, he should locate another section of
          the  vein,  and  begin  the process again.  Since granite rock is
          much harder to dig through, it is much faster to follow the  vein
          exactly and dig around the granite.

               If the character has a scroll or staff of treasure location,
          he  can  immediately locate all strikes of treasure within a vein
          shown on the screen.  This makes  mining  much  easier  and  more
          profitable.



          2.2.4.6  Staircases -

               Staircases are the manner in which you get deeper, or  climb
          out  of  the dungeon.  The symbols for the up and down staircases
          are the same as the commands to use them.  A '<' represents an up
          staircase  and  a '>' represents a down staircase.  You must move
          your character over the staircase before you can use them.

               Each level has at least one up staircase, and at  least  two
          down  staircases.  There are no exceptions to this rule.  You may
          have trouble finding some  well  hidden  secret  doors,  but  the
          stairs are there.



          2.2.4.7  Secret Doors, Passages, And Rooms -



                                       32

           The Dungeons of MORIA


               Many secret doors are used within the dungeon to confuse and
          demoralize  adventurers  foolish  enough to enter.  But with some
          luck, and lots of concentration, you can find these secret doors.

               Secret doors will sometimes hide rooms or corridors, or even
          entire  sections  of  that  level of the dungeon.  Sometimes they
          simply hide small empty closets or even dead ends.

               Creatures in the dungeon will generally know  and  use  this
          secret  doors.   If  they  leave one open, you will be able to go
          right through it.  If they close it behind them you will have  to
          search  for  the  catch  first.   Once  a  secret  door  has been
          discovered by you, it is drawn  as  a  known  door  and  no  more
          searching will be required to use it.



          2.2.4.8  Winning The Game -

               Once your character has progressed into killing dragons with
          but  a  mean  glance  and snap of his fingers, he may be ready to
          take on the Balrog.  The Balrog will appear on every level  after
          level 49, so don't go down there until you are ready for him.

               The Balrog cannot be killed in some of  the  easier  methods
          used  on  normal  creatures.  Because of the Balrog's cunning, he
          will teleport away to another level if a spell such  as  genocide
          is used upon him, and the Balrog cannot be polymorphed, slept, or
          charmed.  Magical spells like coldball are effective against  him
          as  are  weapons,  but  he is difficult to kill and if allowed to
          escape for a time can heal himself.

               If you should actually survive the attempt  of  killing  the
          Balrog,  you  will  receive  the status of WINNER.  Since yo have
          defeated the toughest monster alive, your character is  ready  to
          retire  and  cannot  be  saved.   When  you  quit  the game, your
          character receives a surprise bonus score and is entered into the
          toptwenty file.



          2.2.4.9  Upon Death And Dying -

               If your character falls below 0 hit points, he has died  and
          cannot  be  restored.  A tombstone showing information about your
          character  will  be  displayed  with  the  option  to  print  the
          information to a file.

               After  the  tombstone,  the  toptwenty  list  of  heroes  is
          displayed.   If  your  score  beats  any  of  the toptwenty, your
          character will join this elite rank of heroes.  Otherwise,  well,
          there is always next time...
